	The recent publication of Nabokov&rsquo;s final, uncompleted novel, <i>The Original of Laura</i> (Knopf 2008), as a book of facsimile note cards was a timely reminder of the tangled history of the relationship between the book and the note.</p>

<p>
	In its loving reproduction of the authors&rsquo; note cards in codex form, <i>The Original of Laura</i> performed, at a profoundly visual and tactile level, a morphological theory of media &ndash; that notes could become books, indeed that these two very different forms of writing could in fact be synonymous with one another.&nbsp; But in the cards&rsquo; perforation &ndash; one of the most inspired publishing decisions of this our late age of print &ndash; the note cards&rsquo; possible removal from the book also drew attention to the hole in the book&hellip;that was the note.&nbsp; Without notes, so <i>Laura</i> tells us, we have no books.</p>

Michael Kowal (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1973) 58-72.[/fn]; Poe invented the genre of the published &ldquo;Marginalia;&rdquo; Benjamin created his file-folder monument, Das Passagen-Werk; Arno Schmidt began using note-card cases from which would emerge bibliographic monstrosities like his elephantine novel, Zettels Traum [The Dream of Notes] (1970); Hanns Zischler published a recent volume of stories based on hapless found cartographical notations, &ldquo;I Wouldn&rsquo;t Start From Here&rdquo;: Verzettelte Geschichten [Stories from Notes] (2008); or even the new website <a href=""http://www.thingsinbooks.com/"">Things in Books</a> that records all of the scraps of paper (and much more) found in books across the world &ndash; these are all different ways that individuals over the past two centuries have explored the relationship between the technology of the note and that of the codex, to understand how our notes grow into, out of, alongside of, or simply in our books.</p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">	In thinking about this relationship between notes and books, and the various movements between them, I am interested in addressing the larger question of what happens today when our notes and our books increasingly belong to the same medium.&nbsp; Of course we will continue, in Wallace Stevens&rsquo; word, to &ldquo;jot&rdquo;&nbsp;down our ideas on random slips of paper, as Goethe did on theater notices while drafting the last novella of his life.[fn]GSA 25/W2002.[/fn]</p>
<p>
	But I think it is fair to say that for many of us much of our note-taking is done on the same medium as our book writing &ndash; and here is where our current moment strikes me as crucially different &ndash; <i>and our book reading</i>.&nbsp; As we gradually move to a bookish world that is no longer exclusively defined by the printed book (if it ever was), my question is what happens to this lost sense of metamorphosis surrounding composition &ndash; when &ldquo;all is note&rdquo; we might say?</p>

	It consists of a list of sixty points of keywords down the first and third columns, with annotations in the second and fourth, the whole of which has been crossed out with numerous dashes.&nbsp; The numbered keywords (&ldquo;1. Hazy Morning,&rdquo; &ldquo;2. Hunters assembled,&rdquo; &ldquo;3. Departure&rdquo;, etc.) were to provide the framework for the narrative of Goethe&rsquo;s last novella, &ldquo;Novella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Goethe&rsquo;s cancelled list of keywords tells us many things about the nature of note taking in general and its relationship to writing books more specifically.&nbsp; In that columnar structure that would become increasingly common to Goethe&rsquo;s late writing practices we can see just how important the visualization of writing was prior to narration.&nbsp; Synopsis preceded narration, a fact that would become very apparent, for example, in Stendhal&rsquo;s unpublished autobiography, <i>Vie de Henry Brulard</i> (1835/36), in which his self-narrative is intermingled with topographical views of the childhood places he discusses. &nbsp;</p>

	Are these navigational aides for the writer or illustrations for the reader?&nbsp; Either way, the attempt to &ldquo;take it all in&rdquo; in a single image was, for Romantic writers, one of the note&rsquo;s crucial functions as an antecedent to the serial unfolding of bibliographic narrative.&nbsp; As Samuel Coleridge would write in his notebooks, &ldquo;Without drawing I feel myself but half invested in language.&rdquo;[fn]Samuel Taylor Coleridge, The Notebooks of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ed. Kathleen Coburn (London: Routledge, 1957), vol. 1, &sect;1554.[/fn]&nbsp;Nowhere was this idea more iconically on display than in Goethe&rsquo;s double-helix notation that accompanied his life-shaping aper&ccedil;u, &ldquo;Alles ist Blat [All is leaf/sheet].&rdquo;[fn]The spelling of Blat is in the original. &nbsp;See GSA 26/LV,13, Bl. 166v.[/fn]&nbsp;The entanglement of text and image in Goethe&rsquo;s thought was enacted in those doubled, entangled turns of the handwritten note&rsquo;s &ldquo;illustration.&rdquo;</p>

	If the note served Romantic writers with a crucially visual dimension to their writing, it also served the exact opposite function of non-visualization through the practice of cancellation.&nbsp; The note was above all else a space of non-knowledge, a place where we undo ideas (&ldquo;because the mind of the reader,&rdquo; writes Poe in his &ldquo;Marginalia,&rdquo; &ldquo;wishes to unburthen itself of a <i>thought</i>&rdquo;[fn]E.A. Poe, &ldquo;Marginalia,&rdquo; Democratic Review 14 (November 1844): 484, emphasis in original. &nbsp;Or as Poe would later write in the same article, &ldquo;Just as the goodness of your true pun is in the direct ratio of its intolerability, so is nonsense the essential sense of the Marginal Note&rdquo; (485).[/fn]).&nbsp; In Goethe&rsquo;s leaf of numbered keywords there was a tremendous investment in those marks of crossing-out &ndash; why <i>were</i> there so many of them?&nbsp; Nabokov may have achieved the apex of this art of cancellation in a note included in <i>Laura</i>, where we see him working through synonyms of &ldquo;erasure&rdquo; in which one of the words is itself scribbled out. &nbsp;</p>

	I am interested in the difference between the cross-out in Goethe &ndash; where what is underneath is left to view &ndash; and the scribble in Nabokov &ndash; where the idea is fully occluded from view (but not the act of its having once been thought).&nbsp; When we think about taking notes with our computers today, however much hard drives preserve our writing in multiple different states (as Matthew Kirschenbaum has artfully reminded us),[fn]Matthew G. Kirschenbaum, Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2008).[/fn]&nbsp;it seems a far cry from the layering of assertion and cancellation possible with the technologies of pen and paper that comprise the &ldquo;note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	There is one final feature to Goethe&rsquo;s note that I think brings into view this larger dynamic of presence and absence that seems to be one of the key ways of thinking about the note.&nbsp; And that is its legibility.&nbsp; What strikes me as unique about Goethe&rsquo;s late note-taking practices &ndash; which it should be added often occurred through the mediated relationship with a secretary to whom he dictated his ideas &ndash; is the archival identity that his notes began to assume.&nbsp; The crossed-out list of sixty keywords would be replaced on the same day by this beautifully rendered list of 107 keywords in two folio sheets. &nbsp;</p>

	The note produced in &ldquo;Reinschrift&rdquo; or &ldquo;fair copy&rdquo; becomes an end in itself, not a scrap of cancellations that will itself be cancelled by its subsequent appearance in print.&nbsp; There is an important element of surplus to the note here, a remainder that cannot be incorporated into the printed book, a fact beautifully on display (illegible in reproduction) in the way the handwritten columns are bounded by folds in the paper, a practice that became commonplace to Goethe&rsquo;s late note taking.&nbsp; The note, differentiated through its calligraphic formality from the printed page it would become, is also internally differentiated within itself.&nbsp; In passing from note to book something was necessarily left behind, a something that had to remain legible, however, if we were to understand the way writing in books emerged in time.&nbsp; Nothing seemed to argue more forcefully for the morphological relationship between notes and books than this fair copy list of keywords bound by the fold.</p>

	For early-nineteenth-century writers, note-taking would arguably emerge as <i>the</i> idealized form of writing.&nbsp; More than any other scriptural practice, the note seemed to embody the most basic priorities of what we have come to call Romantic knowledge, whether understood as play, negativity, becoming, the momentary or a &ldquo;progressive universal Poesie.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fluidity of the handwritten note, the ephemerality of its surfaces, the liminality of its legibility between script, scribble, and image, its promise to transcend mediality itself all contributed to the note&rsquo;s preeminence as a space of Romantic thought.&nbsp; As Stendhal wrote in a note on the messiness of his handwriting: &ldquo;<span style=""text-decoration: underline ; letter-spacing: 0.0px"">Writing<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">: this is how I write when my thoughts are treading on my heels. If I write well, I waste them.&rdquo;[fn]Vie de Henry Brulard, Les Biblioth&egrave;ques municipales de Grenoble, vol. 2:782.[/fn] The note captured the speed of human thought.</p>
<p>
	When we study the note today we are in many ways thus stepping into and then out of the shadow of Romanticism.[fn]This cluster is, as I see it, thus genealogically related, albeit in a significantly more critical fashion, to the recent turn in literary history towards marginalia studies and before that text-genetic criticism and in the history of science to the turn to &ldquo;the bench&rdquo; and scientific notebooks, trends which seem deeply indebted to this Romantic legacy. &nbsp;For a different understanding of the place of handwritten notes within intersubjective networks of readers during the Romantic period see Michelle Levy, Family Authorship and Romantic Print Culture (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2008) and Andrew Piper, &ldquo;The Art of Sharing: Reading in the Romantic Miscellany,&rdquo; Bookish Histories: Books, Literature, and Commercial Modernity, 1700-1900 (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2009) 126-147.[/fn]&nbsp;Rather than reify the note as a kind of privileged space of a romantically inspired theory of knowledge &ndash; a reenactment of the mediological nostalgia that was also at the heart of an early-nineteenth-century world of increasingly reproducible objects &ndash; I think when we look at the relationship <i>between</i> notes and books we gain a more critical sense of the specificity of the note&rsquo;s meaning, both then and now.&nbsp; Goethe&rsquo;s fair-copy leaf is significant because it shows us, as materially as one can in a scan of a photocopy of a microfilm of a piece of paper, how different digital note-taking is from the pen and paper kind.[fn]I want to emphasize the way the difficulties of reproduction surrounding the critical study of the note is not just an accident of scholarly method but an important component of our understanding of the note as an articulation of difference.&nbsp; The mediations surrounding &ldquo;note studies&rdquo; is part of our knowledge of notes.[/fn] I don&rsquo;t just mean in terms of the corporal differences between clutching a pointed object and moving one&rsquo;s clenched hand over a limited textured surface while one&rsquo;s back is strongly curved, one&rsquo;s head is slightly askew, and one&rsquo;s eyes stare at the point of contact <i>versus</i> sitting upright, staring straight ahead while one&rsquo;s fingers dance up and down in the peripheral field of one&rsquo;s vision on a variegated plastic surface &ndash; although that alone strikes me as significant enough (the crumpledness of note <i>taking</i> versus the uprightness and divisions of note <i>typing</i>).</p>

<p>
	Rather, it is the sheer material difference between penned paper and printed paper that mattered to Goethe, a difference that showed us something about the nature of thought and what it meant to think about nature.&nbsp; Where many of his contemporaries were hard at work incorporating the manuscriptural note&nbsp;<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px; ""><i>into</i><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px; "">&nbsp;the printed page &ndash; making print more note-like as in Poe&rsquo;s printing of his marginalia or Novalis&rsquo; equation of the printed note as a kind of pollination &ndash; for Goethe notes were as much sediments as they were seeds.&nbsp; They showed us the differences that inhered in ideas and forms, the insurmountable remainders of life. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	When we move from notes on computers, whether in Devonthink, remediated post-it notes, or plain old word documents, to books on computers, whether as pdf, ePub, Kindle.app, or iBook, where will this sense of the morphology, the difference of ideas reside?[fn]Benjamin already intuited this potential obsolescence of the book between note-taking systems when he wrote: &ldquo;The card index marks the conquest of three-dimensional writing, and so presents an astonishing counterpoint to the three-dimensionality of script in its original form as rune or knot notation. (And today the book is already, as the present mode of scholarly production demonstrates, an outdated mediation between two different filing systems. &nbsp;For everything that matters is to be found in the card box of the researcher who wrote it, and the scholar studying it assimilates it into his own card index.)&rdquo; &nbsp;Walter Benjamin, Selected Writings, ed. Marcus Bullock and Michael W. Jennings (Cambridge: Belknap, 1996) 1: 456.[/fn] As Nabokov&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>The Original of Laura</i>&nbsp;so visibly showed us, can there be &ldquo;books&rdquo; without &ldquo;notes&rdquo;?&nbsp; Perhaps the point of the printed book today is that, just as in a world of handwritten notes, in a world of digital notes the printed book will continue to argue for the morphological nature of writing &ndash; that writing, like thought, nature, and the self, must be thought of morphologically as change in time in order to capture the larger truth of who we are and the world we inhabit.&nbsp; Without these material articulations of stadial difference we lose a key piece of knowledge of the world.</p>

	Lists as Fandom, Lists as Knowledge: How Grateful Dead Fans Communicate Through Handwritten Tape Lists and Hyperlinked Tape-Trading Communities</p>
<p>
	Recording technology provided an opportunity to preserve live music and transform it into a tangible, exchangeable object. &nbsp;Among Grateful Dead fans in particular, these musical artifacts instigated a community of tapers and tape traders who performed a specific type of fandom through the circulation of recordings. &nbsp;These fans produced and shared tape lists alongside the recordings that qualified and advertised personal collections. &nbsp;Technological development brought changes to the form, thus transforming the list from hand-written notes to hyperlinked networks. &nbsp;With this transformation, the lists became public and interconnected. &nbsp;Meanwhile (re)digitization techniques multiplied the number of circulating recordings and further complicated the exchange process, necessitating a naming standard and a communal list. &nbsp;Through the list, collectors demonstrate knowledge and state opinions, define fandom, and reveal and hide collections. &nbsp;The lists themselves contain the history and the future of this community.</p>
<p>
	Grateful Dead, the band, and Grateful Dead Productions, the company, supported tape trade, at first unofficially through non-regulation, and later officially through the inception of a taper&rsquo;s section at concerts and a statement sanctioning non-commercial trade among fans. &nbsp;The music industry, however, has been known to fight against this type of informal fan circulation of recordings, often chasing it with updates to copyright law. &nbsp;Yet sociologist Lee Marshall argues that tape collectors &ldquo;actually provide ideological support for the recording industry, helping valorize musical commodities&rdquo;; he thus credits unofficial recordings as enhancements to the industry and the dialogue surrounding it.[fn value=&quot;1&quot;]Marshall, Lee, &ldquo;For and against the Record Industry: An Introduction to Bootleg Collectors and Tape Traders,&rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Popular Music&lt;/em&gt; 22, no. 1 [Jan 2003]: 57-72. &nbsp;Please note: &nbsp;Grateful Dead tapers are NOT bootleggers or pirates. &nbsp;Bootleggers&lt;em&gt; sell&lt;/em&gt; live recordings. &nbsp;Pirates sell previously released commercial material. &nbsp;Grateful Dead tape traders collect, share, and trade live recordings of Grateful Dead concerts often produced by the fan themselves.[/fn]&nbsp;Dead Head tape activity, in particular, proved not only to augment official releases, but also to increase the fan base by extending the concert experience beyond the venues and into the everyday lives of fans. &nbsp;In turn, the tape lists extended the discourse by initiating new relationships and offering an additional space to discuss the music. &nbsp;An examination of tape lists, old and new, provides insight into the specialized knowledge of fans and how they communicate that knowledge to one another.</p>

<h2>
	Listing in Analog</h2>
<p>
	Pictured above is a tape list exemplifying the way fans organize information and communicate to other fans. &nbsp;The left corner of the pictured list identifies it as this fan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Deadlist,&rdquo; indicating the Grateful Dead, organized by year, and printed on August 27, 1993. &nbsp;Specific shows within the list itself are then categorized by location (venue, city, state) and exact date. &nbsp;Other tape lists may include the opening song, a full set list, or musical highlights. &nbsp;These categories exemplify what linguist Natalie Dollar terms &ldquo;show talk,&rdquo; defined as a discourse engaged in by fans when talking at or about a show that demonstrates fan knowledge.[fn value=&quot;2&quot;]Dollar, Natalie, &ldquo;Understanding &lsquo;Show&rsquo; as a Deadhead Speech Situation,&rdquo; in &lt;em&gt;Perspectives on the Grateful Dead: &nbsp;Critical Writings,&lt;/em&gt; ed. Robert G. Weiner [Westport: &nbsp;Greenwood Press, 1999], 89-100.[/fn]&nbsp;&ldquo;Show talk&rdquo; includes referencing shows by venue name, calling the opener, and recounting last night&rsquo;s set list using well-known song nicknames.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">
	Fans who collected tapes extended show talk to include language relevant to the recording technology and tape trade, thus creating a more specific type of fan language I am terming &ldquo;tape talk.&rdquo; &nbsp;The list shown includes two tape talk categories regarding completeness of the tape, &ldquo;set&rdquo; and &ldquo;time.&rdquo; &nbsp;Set noted which parts of the concert are present on the recording. &nbsp;Length quantifies the number of minutes of recorded music. &nbsp;Both figures were particularly important when engaging in equal trade.</p>
<p>
	Tape traders communicated sound quality through &ldquo;source,&rdquo; &ldquo;grade,&rdquo; and &ldquo;gen.&rdquo; &nbsp;Abbreviations denoted sources such as soundboard (BRD or SBD), audience recording (AUD), radio broadcast (FM), and bootleg LP (BLP). &nbsp;Each source has its own benefits, such as clarity from soundboard recordings or ambience found in audience recordings. &nbsp;Grade, a subjective and personal category, labeled the tape according to individual taste and collector knowledge. &nbsp;&ldquo;Gen&rdquo; indicated the generation of the tape, or the distance from the master recording, an essential distinction in analog trade because sound quality noticeably decreased with subsequent copies. &nbsp;&ldquo;Notes&rdquo; provided a space for the collector to elaborate on any item, to engage in show talk and tape talk with potential trading partners. &nbsp;Finally, the &ldquo;from whom&rdquo; column kept a record of personal trades and the circulation of specific tapes. &nbsp;[This type of list served as a quick reference; for examples of more extensive analog notes see <a href=""http://dicklatvala.com/notebooks.htm""><span class=""Internet_20_link""><span class=""T2"">http://dicklatvala.com/notebooks.htm</span></span></a>.]</p>
<h2>
	The Path to Digital</h2>
<p>
	In the year 2000, a group of collectors embarked on a project to digitize and share their collective set of recordings. &nbsp;It started when one collector, known as Raoul Duke, donated his personal CD collection to the group in order to load the CDs onto hard drives, organized by year of recording. &nbsp;These hard drives were to be vined through the group (an old form of distribution whereby one member copied the drive and then mailed it another member and so forth) and sent to Sweden where they would be made accessible to everyone through an FTP server known as TOL. &nbsp;With this project, referred to as &ldquo;The Music Never Stopped Project&rdquo; (TMNSP), the exchange group successfully outlined and implemented standards widely utilized today among all live music collectors.</p>
<p>
	To efficiently use hard drive space and speed up Internet exchange, these collectors needed to compress the music files. &nbsp;At the time consumers of the music industry had begun to turn to MP3 technology. &nbsp;Instead, Dead Heads strictly enforced lossless compression formats such as shorten (shn) and free lossless audio codec (flac) to ensure high quality.</p>
<p>
	When downloading from TOL, traders wanted to browse the hard drives at a glance without taking the time to tediously open the text files and identify specific recordings. &nbsp;So, Matt Vernon, a member of TMNSP, designed a naming standard that would identify the recording in the file name itself. &nbsp;The format includes: two letter band abbreviation, date, information regarding the recording process, the last five digits of the SHN id, sound boundary error reference, and file format. &nbsp;An example file name result would be:</p>

	gd73-07-01.fob-SonyECM22p.kaslow-todd-motb.88528.sbeok.flac16</p>
<p>
	In this example, &ldquo;gd&rdquo; represents the Grateful Dead. &nbsp;The recording was made on July 1, 1973 in front of the soundboard (fob=front of board) using a Sony ECM22P recorder. &nbsp;Harv Kaslow and Craig Todd taped it, and an editing group named Mouth of the Beast (MOTB) digitized, edited, and seeded it. &nbsp;The recording is a FLAC file seeded in 16-bit format.</p>
<p>
	The SHN id serves to identify this recording transferred through a particular set of technologies and edited by a particular people. &nbsp;If the same master tape were to be redigitized and re-seeded, it would receive a new SHN id, given by the SHN id authority, etree.org. &nbsp;The naming standard, and especially the SHN id, became a necessity to identify specific files and prevent duplication as more and more individuals seeded their own personal collections onto the Internet. &nbsp;Therefore, current hard drive lists look like this:</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Sbeok,&rdquo; or, more rarely, &ldquo;SBEfail,&rdquo; refers back to a conflict within the community of traders regarding digital audio and tracking. &nbsp;One method of tracking actually created digital noise. &nbsp;So, when a small group within TMNSP, known as Jerry&rsquo;s Kids, labored to transfer Raoul Duke&rsquo;s CDs, they checked for &ldquo;sound boundary error&rdquo; and labeled the files accordingly.</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/tne/files/images/harvey_katie_figure2.preview.png"" style=""width: 400px; height: 263px; "" /></p>
<p>
	The Music Never Stopped Project and Jerry&rsquo;s Kids defined a standard. &nbsp;Their work laid the foundation for not only the Grateful Dead community but also the larger network of non-commercial circulation of live recordings. &nbsp;Their system is still in use.</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, TOL was eventually shut down. &nbsp;Thankfully, Matt Vernon had already found a more permanent home for the newly-digitized public collection at Archive.org&rsquo;s Live Music Archive (LMA), where the collection is still available today through downloading and streaming. &nbsp;Fans, no matter their age or level of experience, can access LMA and hear the sounds of the Grateful Dead while reading statistics and composing personal reviews.</p>
<h2>
	Documenting Culture</h2>
<p>
	In addition to the Archive.org collection, individual collectors and exchange groups circulate their music through a variety of other FTP servers and bit torrent sites such as etree.org, Lossless legs, Workingman&rsquo;s Dead, and dime-a-dozen. &nbsp;These online social networks and communal archives also serve as repositories for conversation, for modern day tape talk. &nbsp;Fans swap stories and annotate archival information. They recommend recordings and trump each other&rsquo;s opinions. &nbsp;They critique, correct, and relive the experience.</p>
<p>
	Importantly, this banter can, at times, bring light to the true source of a recording as the listeners discuss the nature of the content and the quality. &nbsp;As an example, LMA holds five different recordings for the Grateful Dead concert on September 18,1970. &nbsp;One file displays a very short song list, a small portion of the music played on that night. &nbsp;There are three reviews attached to it (pictured below).</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/tne/files/images/harvey_katie_figure3.preview.png"" style=""width: 400px; height: 261px; "" /></p>
<p>
	The first comment (the most recent) annotates the online document with experiential knowledge of the show itself: &nbsp;the weather, (torrential rain), noteworthy audience members, (Tim Leary and Mayor Lindsey), special guests (Dustin Hoffman and Harry Kellerman), cultural history (Jimi Hendrix&rsquo;s death), personal history (friend waited outside), and a testimony (life altering experience).</p>
<p>
	The two previous reviews serve to correct information connecting this recording to the actual event. &nbsp;One reviewer points out that Dark Star was not played that night and suggests that other listeners and fans check their own notes on this performance. The other reviewer, having already listened to other recordings of this concert, recognized that this version of Sugar Magnolia was not the actual version from the show. &nbsp;To solve the mystery, a curator from LMA added his own notes (pictured below). &nbsp;</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/tne/files/images/harvey_katie_figure4.preview.png"" style=""width: 400px; height: 311px; "" /></p>
<p>
	As you can see, the curator clarified the source of the file song by song while claiming that he himself built this configuration and circulated it among friends beginning in 1997. &nbsp;These types of compilation recordings surface in public archives. &nbsp;Due to SHN ids, and the malleable, publicly accessible archive, items such as this can be (re)documented accurately and circulated accordingly.</p>
<p>
	The avenues through which tape collectors find and interact with one another have changes drastically. &nbsp;Building analog trading networks required patience. &nbsp;Tape traders copied tapes in real-time and waited days, weeks, or months to receive copies of other tapes via snail mail. &nbsp;They searched for specific recordings through monthly fanzines and early online bulletins. As technology shifted, from analog to digital and from paper to electronic, Dead Heads constructed new forms of trade and faster avenues of communication.<span class=""T3""> &nbsp;</span>These mediated tools allow fans instant and widespread communication. &nbsp; Listening to a show and immediately discussing it with an extensive social network of other collectors and fans has become commonplace. &nbsp;Recording technology brought the music away from venues and live concerts; now, fifteen years after the band has stopped performing live, these fans still listen to and comment on the music of the Grateful Dead as part of their daily lives.</p>
<p>
	Beginning in the 1980s, the first academic wave of fandom studies worked within the dichotomous structure of fans vs. fan object, where fans, though seen as &ldquo;beautiful,&rdquo; remained disempowered &ldquo;others.&rdquo; &nbsp;Drawing from Pierre Bourdieu, the second wave identified fan cultures as a reflection of societal structures and habitus. &nbsp;More recently, in the introduction to <span class=""T1"">Fandom: &nbsp;Identities and Communities in a Mediated World,</span> Johnathan Gray, Cornel Sandvoss, and C. Lee Harrington<span class=""T1""> </span>highlight that &ldquo;changing communication technologies and mediated texts contribute to and reflect the increasing entrenchment of fan consumption in the structures of our everyday life.&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;3&quot;]Grey, Johnathan, Cornel Sandvoss, and C. Lee Harrington, eds., &lt;em&gt;Fandom: &nbsp;Identities and Communities in a Mediated World&lt;/em&gt; [New York: &nbsp;New York University Press, 2007], 3.[/fn]&nbsp;Instead of waiting for the tour, the new fanzine, or the letter, Dead Heads are now able to connect with one another in real time, to gather, share, and celebrate the music and those who labored to preserve it.</p>
<p>
	In today&rsquo;s musical environment, in the long-wake of Napster, iTunes, and copyright law reform, the decision of this band to support this activity of their fans should be hailed as an alternative model to the power dynamic designed and implemented by large record companies and their control over the flow and access of recorded sound. &nbsp;With the Grateful Dead, the fans produced the written and digital archive of the band (<span class=""T1"">before</span> the band had a chance to do so). &nbsp;And they built it upon a foundation that they themselves constructed through analog trade. &nbsp;Today, the fan base itself continues to grow as new fans, regardless of age or experience, discover the Grateful Dead and find at their fingertips hours and hours of recorded sound, along with set lists, guided commentary, and technological knowledge communicated and documented by Dead Heads themselves. &nbsp;Fan activity exists as a living archive, a living culture in which the lists and hyperlinked communities not only demonstrate the values and opinions of the community, but become cultural documents in and of themselves.</p>

	Paul Pridgeon in Arlington, Massachusetts sent in to the Found website a to-do list that he picked up off the street, giving it the title &ldquo;There Are Options.&rdquo; What once served as a lonely individual&rsquo;s list of possibilities for passing the time (&ldquo;Go for a walk with someone, go out with someone&hellip;Go to the cemetery and talk with my mom&hellip;Go in my room&rdquo;) is repurposed and given new meaning as a poignant slice of someone&rsquo;s inner life. The forum discussion for this post is exemplary with regard to the compassion that can be expressed among those with a shared experience. Strangers, pseudonymously, virtually, extend themselves to one another emotionally.</p>

	<font face=""Times"">With the end-of-the-century therapeutic culture transforming into a culture of confession, online anonymity allows individuals to voice needs, concerns, fears, and ideas detached from one&rsquo;s own identity. Much online public interaction involves participation in virtual communities: cyber-groups based upon people connecting with others who share similar values, interests and concerns in order to exchange information, gain companionship and provide emotional support (Wellman and Gulia 1999). However, artifacts exhibited on Found&rsquo;s website can serve as conduits for relationships between audience and others, rendered through the nearly visceral representation of digital objects, without access to the creator&rsquo;s intention or the categorization of a particular theme</font>.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	Found began when site creator Davy Rothbart discovered a note, intended for someone else, on the windshield of his car. The note, described on the website (<font color=""#0000ff""><u><a href=""http://foundmagazine.com/"">http://foundmagazine.com</a></u></font>), as containing an &ldquo;amazing mixture of anger and hopefulness,&rdquo; was passed among Rothbart&rsquo;s friends. Interest in this found object led to the creation of a magazine that could serve as a forum for sharing similar &ldquo;finds.&rdquo; Each day, a new found object is posted on the site, typically a note or photograph that is lost or discarded. Found encourages visitors to submit &ldquo;love letters, birthday cards, kids&rsquo; homework, to-do lists, ticket stubs, poetry on napkins, telephone bills, doodles&mdash;anything that gives a glimpse into someone else&rsquo;s life.&rdquo; Found items are sometimes poignant, sometimes funny, always giving a sideways glance into someone&rsquo;s interior world.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	The value of the seemingly intimate, hand-made, misplaced, or discarded item increases exponentially as it is shared through Found&rsquo;s digital platform. Because the visitor to Found has no existing personal connection to these artifacts, meaning and connection is produced in the exchange between the viewer and the digitally present image. As John Berger points out, &ldquo;We never look at just one thing, we are always looking at the relation between things and ourselves&rdquo; (9). When what we are looking at are the expressions of other people&rsquo;s inner lives, we also are participating in the relation between ourselves and others. The digitally present object&mdash;list, photograph, or note between friends&mdash;serves as a conduit for that relationship. Berger&rsquo;s point, however, is that looking inevitably involves bringing oneself to the encounter. Visitors to the site construct narratives around these objects, and the speculative creation of these narratives can be one of the pleasures of Found. In whatever imagined context the audience creates, these artifacts offer a glimpse into the personal and human circumstances of everyday life. Something about the self is revealed or learned, and looking outward is a way of looking inside.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	Lists are a kind of collage, comprised of the little bits of wants and needs that make up a sense of who we are through the things we buy or need to do. The lists on Found&mdash;what warrants their inclusion as finds&mdash;are usually quirky and often show the listmaker struggling with something. Lists help us manage our time, our circumstances, and the emotional weight of our lives. By titling his find &ldquo;Back to the Old Ways,&rdquo; Jonathan Shipley posits the list writer may be trying to change her ways; the list includes Diet Coke, water, tonic, tampons, vitamins and &ldquo;frozen healthy shit,&rdquo; perhaps the beginning of a new diet. The last item on the list, &ldquo;Wine?&rdquo; shows the possibility of a lingering thread of desire for what Shipley calls &ldquo;the old ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	<img alt="""" src=""http://www.foundmagazine.com/images/finds/full/backtotheoldways.gif"" style=""width: 300px; height: 211px; "" /></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	This brief, anonymous list opens an opportunity for women to &ldquo;talk among themselves&rdquo; about the social pressures for thinness. Through Found&rsquo;s online commuity the audience has access to different kinds of lists&mdash;those that are made as goals, with contemplation, and those that are made as reminders, easily checked off. Lists are statements of intention, and both the lists of long term goals and quick everyday reminders reflect the gesture of &ldquo;putting it in writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	Many comments in this forum argue that the listmaker&#39;s perspective may be more of an everyday way of being rather than an isolated event, as women struggle to balance their desires with a sense of what they feel they should do. One poster writes, &ldquo;Yeah, if you add &lsquo;chocolate&rsquo; then this is pretty much what I live on,&rdquo; while others add that the list reminds them of a cousin, a sister, or a roommate. &ldquo;Vanessa in California&rdquo; offers empathy and advice for the anonymous, and absent, listmaker:</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	&ldquo;she&rsquo;s pms-ing, bloated, stressed out, and she needs to get cute for a date tomorrow night. load up on those diet pills my dear. just maybe skip the diet coke, that is a lot of caffeine...&rdquo; Vanessa&rsquo;s direct address shows the evocative power of lists&mdash;even those as mundane as shopping lists&mdash;to create a sense of the listmaker&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	Posting on discussion boards and participating in online forums is an everyday activity, yet there is always a reason behind one&rsquo;s desire to post. In the case of Found, motivation may come from the artifact itself, when a reader wants to offer an interpretation or comment on the object. Others may be inspired to post in a forum because of their compassion for the person who created or owned the found artifact, often as an expression of similar feelings or experiences.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	Some of the lists posted on Found lead to lengthy discussions that are at times wry, tender, cantankerous, and droll. The list that begins &ldquo;dump Adam,&rdquo; found between the pages of a used book, has a casual, offhand feel despite the gravity of its contents. After &ldquo;dump Adam,&rdquo; the listmaker includes &ldquo;grad mufukin school,&rdquo; &ldquo;run &frac12; marathon,&rdquo; &ldquo;run 5 5K&rsquo;s,&rdquo; &ldquo;learn spanish, guitar, typing,&rdquo; &ldquo;waterfall,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Europe.&rdquo; The contrast between the informal list and the enormity of the tasks leads to a witty exchange on the forum. One poster writes, &ldquo;poor Adam. dumping him even made the top of the list. I hope he deserves it, and it&rsquo;s not just part of her plan for &lsquo;an all new better life&rsquo; i.e; &lsquo;lose weight, finish school, then trade up to a new better spouse.&rsquo;&rdquo; Another adds, &ldquo;Dont go to mufukin grad school or you wont get any of those other things done!&rdquo; Running alongside the humorous perspective of these forum posts is a sense of curiosity, as the temporary knowledge community works together to decipher the anonymous listmaker&rsquo;s desires. A forum poster named Sarah notes that the list reminds her of herself, and that she had accomplished many similar things over the preceding year. She then turns her self-expression back to the purposes of the group: &ldquo;But unfortunately for decoding purposes the two biggest mysteries&mdash;undumpable Adam and the unfathomable Waterfall&mdash;were not on my list.&rdquo;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	The online commentary surrounding textual and visual postings can mirror a viewer&rsquo;s critique of a work of art or literature. In that, despite the author or poster&rsquo;s original intentions, perspectives of the objects evolve with the conversations surrounding it, through both negative and positive forum feedback. The frequent pathologization of listmakers is enacted by the audience&rsquo;s deliberation over the object through both sentimental and sometimes harsh critique.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	Christopher Luna&rsquo;s find, which he titles &ldquo;Hide From Yourself,&rdquo; is a peculiar list which includes &ldquo;Beat up a pillow,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hide from yourself,&rdquo; &ldquo;brush hair wrong way&rdquo; and &ldquo;pretend you&rsquo;re on a talk show.&rdquo; From these unusual imaginings, the idea of a singular self takes form. Cait in New Hampshire confesses that she can relate to the author: &ldquo;When I was in around 4th grade I would imagine that all the time. Talk to myself, as if I was on Oprah.&rdquo; What might feel charming and eccentric at first glance is transformed in the forum as posters cast the author as someone potentially suffering. &ldquo;danielle in flagstaff, az&rdquo; notes, &ldquo;this is a list of things to do instead of eating&hellip;the things on the list are on lots of pro-ana sites. just a little fyi.&rdquo; Apparently displeased with danielle&rsquo;s tone, &ldquo;your mom in the laundry room&rdquo; responds, &ldquo;just a little fyi for danielle in flagstaff, this list sounds to me like things autistic people do.&rdquo; <font face=""Times"">The foundation of anonymity increases the pleasure of viewing, and allows audiences freedom to express opinions about the objects.</font></p>

	The Found phenomenon has originated from and continues to thrive due to our human need for community and to be understood by identifying with common expression, organization, ideas, and emotions of anonymous others. The everyday nature of lists can reveal something more substantial and significant about their authors. Since the authors of Found lists are absent, their lists often lead readers to turn contemplation back on themselves, allowing us to learn a little bit about ourselves, every day.</p>

	&ldquo;Los mismos derechos con los mismos nombres&rdquo; or &ldquo;The same rights with the same names&rdquo; is the motto that identifies the current campaign for marriage equality in Argentina. The most visible representatives of this new stage in the history of LGBT activism in the country are Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a di Bello (41) and Alex Freyre (39), &ldquo;two men in love,&rdquo; as they like to define themselves. Freyre and di Bello are HIV positive and active in different organizations such as the Red Cross International and<img alt="""" src=""/tne/files/images/tumblr_kzdnqndmsm1qzs63fo1_1280.service.gif"" style=""width: 400px; height: 400px; "" /> Buenos Aires AIDS Foundation.</p>
<p>
	In April of 2009 they decided to disregard the fact known by everyone: that marriage in Argentina is constrained to two people of the opposite sex. In an example of what Jos&eacute; Mu&ntilde;oz calls &ldquo;disidentification,&rdquo;[fn] For Mu&ntilde;oz, the process of disidentification accounts for the survival strategies practiced by minority subjects who have to deal with a homophobic public sphere that punishes those who do not conform with what is understood as normative citizenship. What is important to grasp here is that Mu&ntilde;oz postulates that, in exploring choices towards self-representation , &ldquo;identifying as/with&rdquo; is not the only political route. Actively &ldquo;dis-identifying from&rdquo; toxic renditions of oneself as, say, a &quot;lesser subject,&quot; has political value. In Freyre&rsquo;s and di Bello&rsquo;s case, I see the disidentification practice as dusting off the mark that assumes that two gay men have no business in a Civil Registry when it amounts to requesting a marriage license.[/fn] the couple requested a license to get married and they were turned down by the clerk on duty at the Civil Registry. Knowing that their request would be rejected and that this purely bureaucratic act could be used to spark a political action rather than mere disillusion, di Bello and Freyre had brought a notary with them who documented the event. Act 2: di Bello and Freyre took their case to court and were finally granted permission to marry by Judge Gabriela Seijas. The Judge declared that, in her understanding, to deny the couple the right to marry was not to honor the constitution&rsquo;s commitment towards rights&rsquo; equality. Buenos Aires&rsquo; mayor, Mauricio Macri, did not appeal the ruling and so the wedding ceremony was set for December 1st, World AIDS day.</p>
<p>
	In Argentina, same-sex couples are able to legalize their status through civil unions in three cities (including Buenos Aires) and the province of R&iacute;o Negro, in Patagonia, since 2003. In Buenos Aires, the <a href=""http://www.thegully.com/essays/argentina/021214_gay_rights_ar.html"">ordinance</a> defines &ldquo;civil union&rdquo; as &quot;the union freely entered into by any two [adult] persons, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation, whose legal residence is in the city of Buenos Aires and who have been in a stable and public relationship for a period of at least two years.&quot; Although the civil union ordinance was received as a big step towards social recognition, the figure of civil union does not grant the contracting parties the same rights enjoyed by married couples. For starters, the lack of an adjectival form of the noun: If those who get married are &ldquo;married,&rdquo; are gays and lesbians &ldquo;unionized&rdquo;? Not the same thing, right?</p>
<p>
	Back to our soon happily married couple: Much to our dismay, the Right mobilizes, and a very active and religiously motivated faction managed to overturn Judge Seijas&rsquo; ruling. Judge Marta Gomez Alsina ordered the wedding be suspended. The case is still open. The couple finally got married in Patagonia, in the southern city of Ushuaia, where governor Fabiana R&iacute;os authorized them to do so. But until the law passes, the matter will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>
	The same-sex marriage law is scheduled to be discussed in congress this year. LGBT organizations and the proponents of different forms of law modeled on eight countries (including Spain) where same-sex marriage is allowed, claim that what is needed is to only change two words for one: The words &ldquo;man and woman&rdquo; would be replaced by &ldquo;the contracting parties&rdquo; (contrayentes in Spanish). Activists state that the specification &ldquo;man and woman&rdquo; was added at the time when the divorce law passed (1987). Before that time, the gender- neutral word &ldquo;contrayentes&rdquo; would have allowed gays, lesbians, and transgender people to simply walk in and request a marriage license no problem. Why nobody did it before 1987? Perhaps because gays, lesbians, and trans people were not organized by then; perhaps the closet was too strong a form of habitation to think about public, dignified co-habitation as something worth fighting for.</p>
<p>
	Even with its backs and forths, the news about the activation of the marriage equality campaign in Argentina gave people around the globe hope. People in the U.S. became competitive in a funny, albeit problematic, way: &ldquo;How come a Third-World country is more advanced than California?&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to Patagonia to get married.&rdquo; This same agenda is pushed in Argentina through activists who try to entice law- makers by arguing that they would be making history if they beat Mexico, for example, where the debate was recently re-activated. &ldquo;The first country in Latin America to pass gay marriage;&rdquo; politicians weigh the pros and cons of such a first.</p>
<p>
	Activists and law proponents state that polls show that 70% of the population is in favor or at least supportive of the marriage equality law. After all, there is already the civil union law, the establishment of gay-friendly neighborhoods such as San Telmo, an Annual International Tango Queer Festival, a very visible and famous trans-diva (Florencia de la V), several queer bands including Kumbia Queers (be sure to check their <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m2ELLw-_Dw"">&ldquo;La isla con chikas,&rdquo;</a> a remake of Madonna&rsquo;s &ldquo;La isla bonita,&rdquo;) and even a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu7nKR0t5zQ"">bank commercial featuring a trans woman</a> which shows that economic institutions may lead the way to tolerance when it is favorable to their interests.</p>
<p>
	Many questions emerge, though. One is why do those who oppose marriage equality feel threatened by it? And, further, what makes them such active militants &ldquo;against&rdquo; other people&rsquo;s rights? A na&iuml;ve question, some might say, especially when we look at history and revisit examples of racial tension, misogyny, and xenophobia, which are as current as homophobia. I still believe that, while we study the &ldquo;predicament of the Right,&rdquo; lawmakers and politicians should know better. A subject who is denied a right based on his/her sexual orientation is publicly postulated as a lesser subject. What is required from those who govern us, or from those whose decisions have impact in our lives, is that they make life more livable for the underrepresented, as in the case of queers. I see a chain of cause and consequence in a room where a same-sex marriage law is turned down and the death of a young effeminate boy or a butch woman. I cannot help but see the connection between those who strive for happy lives and are denied of that right and those whose lives are taken away because they appear as deviant or impostors, as in the case of Jorge Steven Lopez Mercado.</p>

	Queer people are divided over the issue of marriage because, some argue, we, as queers, should be wary of falling into the lures of homo- normativity; our identity, marked so much by the joy of being different, by the utopia of creating new institutions, new affective relations, new ways of orienting ourselves in the world (as in Sara Ahmed&rsquo;s <em>Queer Phenomenology.</em>) I think that the curve that goes from Jorge Steven&rsquo;s brutal assassination to marriage equality is our field of struggle. Settling on limited rights opens the door for misperceptions of queer people as those who deserve to die like Mercado did.</p>
<p>
	The Argentinean LGBT motto &ldquo;the same rights with the same names&rdquo; calls for equality; from &ldquo;man and woman&rdquo; to &ldquo;contracting parties.&rdquo; This may sound shocking to many, not only to religious fundamentalists but also to gay constituencies more used to the politics of advancing alternative sexualities than to the drive to be contracting parties ready to utter matrimonial vows. But, while it may seem weird or excessive to connect a happy married couple to a murder victim, I believe that the more we see legal parties approving progressive proposals benefiting gays, lesbians, and trans people, the less we will have to regret the loss of precious lives such as the lives of those who die under the weight of ignorance and intolerance.</p>

	<i>In Remembrance of George Steven Lopez Mercado (1990-2009)</i></p>
<p>
	I learned about the brutal murder of the Puerto Rican George Steven Lopez Mercado from an email from filmmaker Carmen Oquendo-Villar. I first met Carmen at <a href=""http://theneweveryday.com/index.php?title=Main_Page"">&lsquo;The New Everyday&rsquo; participatory unconference</a> in New York and then Carmen and I became friends on Facebook and have exchanged two or three emails since. Her first email about Mercado shared only a very few details of the crime: &ldquo;Last week in Puerto Rico, Jorge Steven L&oacute;pez Mercado&nbsp;was decapitated, dismembered and burned by a john who got mad because Jorge was not a &lsquo;real woman&rsquo;.&rdquo; But the short email clearly showed Carmen&rsquo;s affection for the story. I then joined the Mercado Facebook page, started to look for more information about him, followed the related Facebook posts about the memorial in New York, and have read more emails of Carmen about the up-dates. Although I have never been in Puerto Rico, I started to get to know Steven virtually and decided to write a short essay in remembrance of him.</p>
<p>
	What does this description of my learning process tell us about remembrance, visual culture, and new media? Is it too idiosyncratic to lead to any conclusions? Does it tell anything beyond the obvious?</p>
<p>
	Well, I learned about Steven via a personalized narrative, by which I mean an introduction to the story by a friend or an acquaintance. Of the many shocking personal and social tragedies around the world, this one caught my attention because it caught Carmen&rsquo;s attention. And then I decided to join the Facebook group to show my solidarity and commemorate Steven, sent invitations to others and shared a few pieces of information about him via Facebook status updates and Twitter feeds.</p>
<p>
	This was not only my story of learning and remembering: many others started to show their solidarity and commemorate him by sharing information online. Before engaging in the same type of commemorative practices, however, we connected to the story through different routes. Some people heard of the murder from the mass media and joined the Facebook group later. For them, the news came from traditional media sources, but their commemorative practices were often in the realm of new media. Others, like me, learned about the story from personalized narratives, but remembered Steven in online public spheres. And many heard of the news on social networking sites and online news services and started to commemorate Steven within the same spheres.</p>
<p>
	Two things strike me as particularly noteworthy in this story of news production and commemoration.</p>
<h3>
	1. Personalized narrative as introduction to further narratives</h3>
<p>
	First, it shows how introductory personalized narratives can help us when we have to choose from many competing stories. You can (and want to) provide your attention only to a very small number of stories and friends can help decide which those will be. Friends&rsquo; personalized narratives work as leads to the news items and navigate you in the jungle of news narratives.</p>
<p>
	The personalized narrative is often shared directly on the social networking site. But in other cases &ndash; such as in my case with Carmen &ndash; it comes from an email, a phone call or an in-person conversation. It serves as a tour guide, a new type of lead to the other narrative construction called &lsquo;news.&rsquo;[fn] As Bird and Dardenne noted about the interrelations between news and narratives, &ldquo;It is important to begin looking more critically at the narrative qualities of news. While news is not fiction, it is a story about reality, not reality itself. Yet because of its privileged status as reality and truth, the seductive powers of its narratives are particularly significant.&rdquo; Elizabeth Bird and Robert W. Dardenne, &quot;Myth, Chronicle, and Story: Exploring the Narrative Qualities of News,&quot; in James Carey, ed., <i>Media, Myths, and Narratives: Television and the Press</i> (Beverly Hills: Sage 1988) [/fn]According to Michael Schudson, &ldquo;A news story is both news and a story. Because it is a story, readers can expect it to have a beginning, a middle, and an end, and to operate by some standard conventions of narrative prose.&rdquo;[fn] Michael Schudson, <i>The Sociology of News</i>, [New York, London: W.W. Norton &amp;amp; Company, 2003], 177[/fn]</p>
<p>
	But in journalism not only textual news items are deeply connected to narratives, but photographs also.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Some photographers would like to tell a story by the photograph. Writing about Margaret Bourke-White&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Flood Leaves Its Victims On The Bread Line&rdquo; photo John Tagg notes that &ldquo;What is distinctive about Bourke-White&rsquo;s photograph is not that it inscribes an act of seeing, but that it constructs a legible message, a pictorial summation from which the arbitrariness of chance and the excess of particularity that afflict photography are strangely drained. The viewpoint is a function of composition, and the composition is painstaking and precise.&rdquo;[fn] John Tagg, &ldquo;Melancholy Realism: Walker Evans&rsquo;s Resistance to Meaning,&rdquo; <i>Narrative</i> 11, no.1 [January 2003]: 13[/fn] Bourke-White used composition to express a certain narrative.</p>
<p>
	Viewers also use their imagination to interpret a photograph. When in 1895 <i>McClure&rsquo;s Magazine</i> published a newly discovered daguerreotype reproduction of President Lincoln, the readers constructed various creative narratives for it. For instance Brooklyn newspaper editor Murat Halstead gave a rather poetic interpretation: &ldquo;This was the young men with whom the phantoms of romance dallied, the young man who recited poems and was fanciful and speculative, and in love and despair, but upon whose brow there already gleamed the illumination of intellect, the inspiration of patriotism.&rdquo;[fn] Cara A. Finnegan, &ldquo;Recognizing Lincoln: Image Vernaculars in Nineteenth-Century Visual Culture,&rdquo; <i>Rhetoric and Public Affairs</i> 8, no. 1 [Spring 2005]: 31[/fn] Halstead projected his general knowledge and imagination of Lincoln into this particular image and found all his ideas and dreams represented in it.</p>
<p>
	Newspaper photos are also often surrounded by texts. The text presents a narrative about the context of the photograph or invents a new context for it. Texts can also help recycle images by adding new interpretation to the same image. As Susan Sontag wrote about the image&rsquo;s dependence on these contextual explanations: &ldquo;its meaning &ndash; and the viewer&rsquo;s response &ndash; depend on how the picture is identified or misidentified; that is, on words.&rdquo;[fn] Susan Sontag, <i>Regarding the Pain of Others</i> [New York: Picador, 2003], 29&lt;[/fn]</p>
<p>
	And finally, people often would like to tell a story by means of a picture. As Rosalind C. Morris noted in connection with the Abu Ghraib images, if we recall the shock of the first sighting of the photos &ldquo;what offended us was less the torture than the apparent enjoyment expressed in the faces of those who were its perpetrators.&rdquo;[fn] Rosalind C. Morris, &ldquo;The War Drive: Image Files Corrupted,&rdquo; <i>Socialtext</i> 25, no. 291 [Summer 2007]: 103[/fn] The torturers enjoyed <i>their</i> narratives. Another example is Eliott Erwitt&rsquo;s photos of the &lsquo;Kitchen debate&rsquo; between U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet Premier Nikota Krushchev. The images were meant to represent the economic differences between the two countries. And Nixon used the photos for a slightly different narrative later in his presidential campaign.</p>
<p>
	In Steven&rsquo;s case, Carmen&rsquo;s personalized narrative led me to the <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jorge-Steven-Lopez-Mercado-1990-2009/203083303382?v=wall"">Facebook memorial</a>, which is a Facebook fan page. I saw the first image of Steven on the front page and then many typical Facebook images of him and his everyday life in the <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jorge-Steven-Lopez-Mercado-1990-2009/203083303382?v=photos"">&lsquo;Photos&rsquo;</a> section. The page provides the visitors not only with images, but also with a little bit of textual interpretation about the details of the crime and the social, cultural and legal relevance of the case. It is a fan page, which looks like a personal profile - just as all fan pages on Facebook - and conveys the message that those who join the group become somehow Steven&rsquo;s fans and friends at the same time. And as Steven&rsquo;s fans and friends, we are entitled to glance at all those ephemeral, hopeful and happy images of his life. The page gives subjective context to the mass media coverage of the story and brings Steven close to the viewer.</p>
<p>
	Out of the four types of narratives I explained in connection with press photographs, two are relevant for the Mercado Facebook page: texts helped contextualize the story and the photographs (just like traditional newspaper texts) and the viewers can imagine narratives to the images (just like in the case of the Lincoln daguerreotype). The perception of the images was also very much shaped by the social context of Facebook, especially by the social networking site&rsquo;s culture of presenting banal images of our everyday lives. But beyond the traditional narratives related to news photographs, this Facebook group has also become home for many textual and visual commentary. People have commented on the Wall of the Facebook profile, in a few cases they also commented on images and they posted three images as commentary under &lsquo;Fan Photos.&rsquo; On these images fans&rsquo; bodies serve as sites of social memory: they imitate Steven&rsquo;s gestures. One <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=3039129&amp;op=1&amp;o=global&amp;view=global&amp;subj=203083303382&amp;id=623378173"">response image</a> sends a textual message projected onto the image: &ldquo;Stop Hate Crimes.&rdquo; These commentaries provide the images with new types of narratives extending the already long list of narratives related to news photographs.</p>
<p>
	But there was also more to the encounter with Steven&rsquo;s images, than simply the production and compilation of various narratives. The Mercado - images somehow &lsquo;spoke&rsquo; to us. They provoked feelings, emotions which are hard to describe only by words or by narrative structures. The typology of narratives I gave suggests that images gain power by our words and by our narrative constructions based also on words. This dependence on language seems particularly relevant for journalistic imagery; according to Barbie Zelizer &ldquo;From their earliest uses, images have been looked at as the fluff of news, material that is secondary and adjunct to the words at their side.&rdquo;[fn] Barbie Zelizer, &ldquo;Death in Wartime: Photographs and the &lsquo;Other War&rsquo; in Afghanistan,&rdquo; <i>The Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics</i> 10, no. 3 [2005], 27 [/fn]Some theories, however, claim that images can escape our language-based interpretations and possess a unique presence. For instance Hans-Ulrich Gumbrecht differentiates between the &ldquo;meaning effects&rdquo; and the &ldquo;presence effects&rdquo; of images and advocates for a new focus on exploring our immediate encounters with pictures.[fn] Hans-Ulrich Gumbrecht, <i>Production of Presence: What Meaning Cannot Convey</i> [Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2004], 1-20[/fn] Steven&rsquo;s images have certainly found their ways directly to many hearts. They spoke &ndash; and not always in words and narratives.</p>
<p>
	In sum, my meeting with the Mercado story started with a personalized narrative as lead. With the personalized narrative by my side, I entered a diffuse space filled with narratives and non-narrative experiences of commemoration.</p>
<h3>
	2. Sharing as a commemorative act</h3>
<p>
	The Mercado story shows the presence and power of what I call &lsquo;remembering through sharing&rsquo; in contemporary new media cultures. Much has been written on the ways in which societies remember. Well-known sites of memory include monuments, poems, songs, but even such unique sites found their ways to the theory of cultural memory as paintings, photographs, dress codes and embodied sites of memory like handshakes and imitations of gestures. These traditional acts of commemoration are still relevant in contemporary societies.</p>
<p>
	But we can observe a few new cultural practices as well. In the case of George Steven Lopez Mercado, people expressed their compassion with him by sharing information about the murder on social networking sites. They shared related news articles and information about the Mercado Facebook page, they tweeted and posted status updates, commented on the fan page. In many cases they also called for action in their online commentary. But even without added commentary, sharing the information about the case, the Mercado Facebook page or about other related news items already served as acts of solidarity and remembrance.</p>
<p>
	Sharing information online about a case like this is a quick and powerful way to express solidarity. It is quick, because it does not require more than a few seconds from you. It is powerful, because the low barriers of distribution enable you to broadcast the news to many at the same time. It is important to note, however, that in most of the cases you broadcast to a certain group of people, to your fellow &lsquo;friends&rsquo; and &lsquo;followers,&rsquo; but not to &lsquo;all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>
	Moreover, sharing information online as an act of remembrance is often ephemeral. Communities need rites to remember something for a long time. As Paul Connerton emphasizes in <i>How Societies Remember</i>: &ldquo;all rites are repetitive, and repetition implies continuity with the past.&rdquo;[fn] Paul Connerton, <i>How Societies Remember</i> [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989], 45[/fn] Users of social networking sites share information about many tragic events; in this sense their practices are repetitive. They might also decide to remember an event from year to year by repeated status updates, tweets and similar activities. But in most of the cases, their early and passionate acts of solidarity simply fade away.</p>
<p>
	Just consider the recent <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=48341343351"">Facebook</a> group about Oph&eacute;lie Bretnacher, a French student, who went to the Hungarian capital to study with a European Union scholarship and disappeared after a late night party in December 2008. Her body was found two months later in the Danube with no signs of foul play. The police decided to rule the story as suicide. During the two months of search the mass and new media in Hungary and all around Europe followed closely the case. The related Facebook solidarity group had almost thirty thousand members. After the body has been found, however, media outlets have started to abandon the story, even though the victim&rsquo;s parents have never agreed with the suicide explanation. Following the trend of mass media, the Facebook page has also started to have less and less comments. Now the activity of the group is mostly related to communicational and professional conflicts between the Hungarian and the French police. Oph&eacute;lie Bretnacher, who used to be in the middle of attention all around Europe, became one victim among the many victims of unsolved tragic mysteries. Her day of disappearance is not repetitively remembered among the many thousand members of the Facebook group, her lovely personality is no longer widely commemorated. Nonetheless, there are members who do post comments on the page and organize protests. And these members might be able to trigger a wide-ranging and long-term remembrance by effective campaigns. But chances are high that they will not start such a movement, or even if they start, might not succeed in the fight for attention.</p>
<p>
	Online commemoration seems a little bit like &lsquo;news:&rsquo; central to us for a short time, but forgettable on a long run. Just like traditional news, sharing the information on social networking sites is very effective in triggering social solidarity. And personalized narratives along with personalized visual and textual memorial sites contribute to this triggering effect.</p>
<p>
	But sharing information online is often very ineffective as a long-term act of commemoration. Online remembrance is a mixture of news production, news dissemination and commemoration. With one hit on the &lsquo;share&rsquo; button we spread the dense narrative construction called news, express solidarity and commemorate. But we often do not ever repeat this action again in connection with the same event.</p>
<p>
	The news-like characteristics of online commemoration have very practical implications. To raise the question in particular:</p>
<p>
	What will be our yearly online rite to commemorate George Steven Lopez Mercado?</p>
<p>
	Who will start those ritualistic performances?</p>
<p>
	And who will persist on sustaining them?[fn] I would like to thank the Hungarian Ministry of Education and Culture for supporting my work this year with the Ernő K&aacute;llai Art History Grant and to Ri Pierce-Grove for her comments on this essay.[/fn]</p>

	After the foliage, when all the flowers and the leaves had fallen and the trees were completely naked. &nbsp;They felt shame and went to hide.</p>
<p>
	Then God, who wanted to punish them, did punish them.</p>
<p>
	So the trees felleth. &nbsp;All at once. So many heavy trees fell down at the same time that they made a thundering sound. &nbsp;Then people realized that the gods were furious. &nbsp;Because the earth was trembling with divine fury. &nbsp; It was so hard the impact of the trees falling that the oceans quaked and produced giant waves that swallowed the earth.</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	http://www.youtube.com/v/o5QPDDweieQ</p>
<p>
	And all that fury had a reason to be. &nbsp;The Gods were angered by the homosexuals that were living on earth. &nbsp;And they were not going to stop knocking down trees with the wind, dead and naked trees until there were no more homosexuals on earth.</p>
<p>
	So then a group of very compassionate people devoted to God and the good of others decided to start slaying homosexuals so the gods wouldn&#39;t be upset anymore.</p>
<p>
	Every time they killeth a homosexual &nbsp;the gods did feel a bit better. &nbsp;So when they finished slaying the homosexuals &nbsp;and they burned them all at the center of the universe, then the gods were contented and the winds and the oceans calmed down. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	And new trees started growing, with little fresh flowers and leaves. &nbsp;The little girls frolicked in the gardens wearing their little pink dresses with ribbons. &nbsp;And the boys &nbsp;playeth with their little trucks and guns. &nbsp;There was peace and harmony because that was the will of the Lord.</p>
<p>
	<span>And for each boy with a little dick there was a girl with a little hole. &nbsp;Everything was carefully calculated, because one day they were going to marry and have more children because </span><span>in the wisdom and plan of Almighty God the marriage relationship between man and woman was provided.</span></p>
<p>
	And every child of the church understood that they were called to sainthood through marriage. &nbsp;So God never got upset again. &nbsp;There was no reason to get upset. &nbsp;God geteth upset when he sees homosexuals. &nbsp;But there were no more left. &nbsp;God also gets upset when people don&#39;t pray. &nbsp;But everybody prayeth. &nbsp;God also gets upset if people commit adultery or lie with their neighbor. &nbsp;But nobody was lying with their neighbors or committing &nbsp;adultery. &nbsp;God also geteth upset if people cook the lamb upside down without salt or if they cook bread with yeast. &nbsp;But nobody was adding yeast to their bread and everybody turneth the salty lamb right side up.</p>
<p>
	<span>And every chil</span><span> d of the church understood that they were called to sainthood through marriage. &nbsp;So God never got upset again. &nbsp;There was no reason to get upset. &nbsp;God gets upset when he sees homosexuals and other unnatural relationships. &nbsp;But there were no more unnatural relationships left. &nbsp;God also gets upset if people don&#39;t pray. &nbsp;But everybody was praying. &nbsp;God also gets upset if people commit adultery or &nbsp;sleep with their neighbor. &nbsp;But nobody was sleeping with their neighbors or committing &nbsp;adultery. &nbsp;God also gets upset if people cook the lamb upside down without salt or if they cook bread with yeast. &nbsp;But nobody was adding yeast to their bread and everybody turned the lamb right side up.</span></p>
<p>
	And that they had to help the poor he added. &nbsp;So they changed the name of the poor . &nbsp; So everything was okay, there were no more poor in the biblical sense. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	And to the ones who insisted on staying poor they told them that there was a better world awaiting them, but they had to die first.</p>
<p>
	Then the poor got very happy, because they would be welcome in the kingdom of the Lord.</p>
<p>
	But then the rich, who had invented the lie got jealous, they also wanted to enter the kingdom of the Lord, so they started praying and they said: &nbsp;It&#39;s not true that the rich will not enter heaven, heaven is full of millionaires. &nbsp;Heaven is full of americans because God loves America!</p>
<p>
	Back up Satan, yelled the demons and they spat some disgusting fluids.</p>
<p>
	So people on earth kept reading and learning about their origins</p>
<p>
	Adam was created from dust and Eve was a rib</p>
<p>
	No, yelled the women, Eve was not a rib, she was made out of a rib!</p>
<p>
	And the men said, Adam was alone, so God created Eve for him and deliberately after him</p>
<p>
	That&#39;s why we eat &nbsp;pork ribs and the beef ribs because it reminds &nbsp;us of Adam&#39;s companion and the sanctity of marriage</p>
<p>
	And they warned christians about the chaos and disorder that would arise if people wouldn&#39;t get married. &nbsp;The world would rot in fornication, rubbish and promiscuity.</p>
<p>
	Then the women started throwing the boiling water from their pots on their clothes to wash away their sins. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span>And the malevolant infidels began to insinuate what should not to be insinuated. &nbsp;How come he </span><span>was already &nbsp;33 years old and not &nbsp;married? &nbsp;No! The faithfull &nbsp;shouted. &nbsp; No!  &nbsp;Jesus was not gay! &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
	He wasn&#39;t &nbsp;married yet because he was very busy healing the ill and the destitute </p>
<p>
	<span>And what was all that &nbsp;bleeding heart concern for the poor? &nbsp;Was He a &nbsp;leftist? &nbsp; No, Jesus was not a communist! &nbsp;The faithfuls shouted . &nbsp; He was a little confused with the subject of the poor &nbsp;but he never &nbsp;actively supported any revolution!  &nbsp; &nbsp;He was the son of God and Holy Mary, &nbsp;mother of God, pray for us sinners, now</span><span> and at the hour of our death...</span></p>
<p>
	And God said to them: Thou shall not kill!  </p>
<p>
	But they killed the deers and hung the heads in their living rooms ,</p>
<p>
	And the warriors got jealous and said:  &nbsp;Why can the hunters hang the heads of the &nbsp;deers in their homes? We also want to hang the heads of the ones we killed! </p>
<p>
	So the warriors &nbsp;hung in their homes the heads of their enemies!   &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	And the blood kept running on Earth and it turned into rivers of spilled blood  . &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span>And they killed the chickens, and they killed th</span><span>e children and they killed the cows and they killed the women, and they killed the pigs, and they killed the men, and they killed the bulls and they killed the soldiers and they killed the fish...</span></p>
<p>

<p>
	And the priests said is the fault of the homosexuals!</p>
<p>
	And the bishops said is the fault of the promiscuous and immoral women !</p>
<p>
	And the women said: It is fault of the war ! </p>
<p>
	And God said unto them: Thou shall not steal</p>
<p>
	<span>But they continu</span><span>ed stealing</span></p>
<p>
	And Armageddon and The Angels came down from heaven &nbsp;playing golden &nbsp;harps</p>

	Legal Aid Clinic for Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation Discrimination</p>
<p>
	(University of Puerto Rico Law School)</p>
<p>
	By: Jorge A. Col&oacute;n Ortiz (translated by the author)</p>
<p>
	The words &quot;crime&quot; and &quot;hate&quot; seem to be axioms of the same act. In &nbsp;the legal field, locally as well as internationally, when we refer to a hate crime, the discussion points to the analysis of behavior that is motivated by having a prejudice of an individual&#39;s because it belongs or perceive that belongs to a specific group.</p>
<p>
	The laws which seek to deter people from committing these crimes, the so-called hate crimes, &nbsp;normally protect the people that became victims by their actual or perceived race, religion, ethnicity, political ideas, disabilities, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, social status, marital status, among other.</p>
<p>
	In Puerto Rico, the courts have never dealt with a crime motivated by hate, or at least they have never recognized one as such. &nbsp;However, in recent months, in Puerto Rico has been local and international pressure advocating for the judgment as a hate crime of the recent murder of the 19-year-old Jorge Steven Lopez Mercado.</p>
<p>
	Coincidentally, on October 28, 2009, the President of the United States, Barack Obama, signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which served the purpose of including into the federal hate crime law of 1969, language regarding the victims gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability.</p>
<p>
	The Act also establishes a wider jurisdiction to investigate federal hate crimes in those states in which they were committed, so charges could be filed under this statute if a state government takes no action on the matter. This provision of the law applies to Puerto Rico as it is a territory of the United States. However, local statutes give our government its own mechanisms to deal with a felony like this.</p>
<p>
	Under the new Penal Code of Puerto Rico (2004), there is not a specific modality on hate crimes. However, Section 72 (q) of that code, establishes what is considered in law an aggravation of the felony when &ldquo;hate&rdquo; constitute a motivation for the perpetration.</p>
<p>
	This section of the code provides that it will be considered an aggravating factor if &quot;the offense was committed or motivated by prejudice toward and against the victim because of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, [...].&rdquo; For the purpose of establishing motive as provided in this subsection it will not suffice to prove that the convict has a particular belief, nor to prove that the person convicted for the hate crime merely belonged to a particular organization.&rdquo; &nbsp;It is important &nbsp;to notice &nbsp;the fact that this provision does not seek to suppress the citizen&rsquo;s freedom of speech. This aggravating factor of hate crime will not apply when someone makes a racist or homophobic remark, but it does apply instead when there is evidence that an already determined crime is motivated by one of these factors.</p>
<p>
	It is also important to point out that to prove that the crime was committed by reason of hate of a particular group, the prosecutor has to have the evidence needed to prove that the motivation to commit that specific crime was a feeling animosity against this group or sector.</p>
<p>
	Therefore, we can argue that in our country there is no such thing as a hate crime but instead, an offense that may be vulnerable to an increased sentence if it is proved that the motivation of the crime was hate of one of the protected groups. In Puerto Rico the maximum sentence is of 99 years which is exactly what the confessed murderer of Jorge Steven Lopez, Juan Martinez Matos, will get if he is found guilty of first degree murder; for obvious reasons this kind of conviction does not undergo an increase in the term. This is why the effect of a prosecution under this aggravating factor is symbolic because it will show us what constitutes the public policy of the state, at least as expressed in legislation, to reject this type of crime, and in favor of the struggle for equality and respect for diversity of human beings. &nbsp;Nevertheless, if this aggravating factor arises in a felony that doesn&rsquo;t reach this maximum level of the sentence, it will have a material effect in the increase of the sentence.</p>
<p>
	Hate crimes are part of world history. Just recall the Holocaust era when millions of Jews were murdered by the Nazi regime as a result of their religion. The motivations of this regime were &nbsp;apparent and obvious in the speech and it was blatantly open. However, when it is a hate crime which involves only two individuals, the person who wants to prove that it was indeed a hate crime will be required to show the necessary evidence to make it abundantly clear that there was a motivation regarding hate.</p>
<p>
	Based on how our system works, an aggravating factor such as a &quot;hate crime&quot; would have its greatest impact in the field of judicial proceedings.</p>
<p>
	Once the court finds the defendant guilty, the prosecutor may ask for permission to show evidence that proves the aggravating factor and thus result in an increased penalty. That provision, contained in Rule 162.4 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, also provide that a hearing be held if there is a real dispute as to a material fact that requires proof.</p>
<p>
	It is, then, once the prosecutor believes that the offense constitutes a hate crime, where lies the responsibility of bringing the aggravating factor to life, or instead that it remains only as a legal concept that never comes into life, as just words in the language of the law.</p>
<p>
	This &nbsp;way of addressing the misconduct in social behavior that leads these hate crimes to be committed may seem incomplete in principle when it is not given the full name that it deserves: hate crime. &nbsp;In conclusion, the state&#39;s attempt to criminalize such conduct falls short in its goal because we don&rsquo;t have &nbsp;specific legislation that addresses the details of the issue and that requires state officials to use the tools necessary to deter potential offenders.</p>
<p>
	Hate crimes are the result of distorted social education, an endorsement of intolerance, and the exaltation of difference and classification, rather than an embracement &nbsp;of diversity and inclusion. Although our law provides for these behaviors to be gradually eliminated, the state is the agent responsible for moving the machinery of justice to compel citizens to educate and develop the respect for those around them, who may not share the same thinking and lifestyle.</p>

	By: Jorge A. Colon Ortiz (Translated by Karlo Karlo)</p>
<p>
	Who would ever think that the stories of Jorge Steven Lopez and Matthew Shepard would have some parallels? They were certainly not born within the same social and cultural context, neither born into families with similar economic status. But, they are certainly victims of social prejudice, prior and after their death. They are both victims of hate-crimes.</p>
<p>
	Matthew Shepard was a 21-year-old student at the University of Wyoming, located in the city of Laramie. On October 7, 1998, Matt (as his friends called him), was taken to the outskirts of the city of Laramie by two men who tied him to a fence and beat him until he was comatose. It wasn&rsquo;t until 18 hours later that a bicyclist found Matt while passing by in front of what he thought was a scarecrow. &nbsp;Five days later at the city&rsquo;s regional hospital they young Matt died. &nbsp;Matt&#39;s murderers, Aaron McKinney and Russell Anderson, were found guilty and both sentenced to two consecutive life sentences.</p>
<p>
	Jorge Steven Lopez Mercado was a 19-year-old resident of the municipality of Caguas, Puerto Rico. On November 13, 2009, Jorge Steven was murdered, decapitated, dismembered and partially burned by his self-confessed murderer. The murder occurred in the town of Cayey, Puerto Rico. The murderer of Jorge Steven&rsquo;s trial is yet to begin.</p>
<p>
	Let&rsquo;s start with the most obvious similitudes in order to establish parallels between these two cases. Both Jorge Steven and Matt were young, slender, of affable character, pleasant and very much loved by their relatives. They were also openly gay and their parents had embraced their son&rsquo;s homosexuality and were very supportive respectively. &nbsp;Both young men were brutally murdered in a remote area away from the city.</p>
<p>
	However, what makes these two cases even more interesting are both the reaction of the murderers and the community at large following the assassination.</p>
<p>
	<span>Matt&#39;s murderers confessed that the reason for beating the youngster was a lesson not to mess with heterosexuals. &nbsp;On the other hand, Jorge Steven&rsquo;s murderer, Juan Jose Mart&iacute;nez Matos, confessed that he killed his victim after a disappointing gender-clothes association led him to realize that Jorge was not a woman. &nbsp;This hatred towards a particular sector of the population is</span><span> </span><span>a homogeneous trait between the two cases.</span></p>
<p>
	Moreover, questions, doubts, and moral issues were raised in regards to the innocence of both victims due to the prevalent prejudice towards this particular sector and the issue of homosexuality. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	As if the case of Jorge Steven needed more surrealness and indignation, the officer in charge of the investigation, Angel Rodr&iacute;guez Col&oacute;n, publicly argued that the victim was partly responsibility for what had happened to him: &ldquo;These type of people know ahead of time what awaits them when they go out in the streets and get into this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In Matt&#39;s case, arguments aimed at blaming the victim established that he had sexually flirted with the murderers and this kind of behavior would most likely yield to violent behavior.</p>
<p>
	Both crimes also raised questions about the sexual orientation of the murderers, in Jorge Steven&rsquo;s case his murderer pleaded to the press not to be labeled as a homosexual.</p>
<p>
	Overlapping these two cases is also the issue of possible drug abuse by both murderers. &nbsp;McKinney&rsquo;s possible addiction to methamphetamine was widely discussed within the U.S. media, while in the case of Juan Jose Martinez it was the use of cocaine. &nbsp;In both cases it was argued whether these substances propelled the murderers to act in such a violent manner as to lead them to brutally kill their victims.</p>
<p>
	Martinez also confessed to police that while serving in jail for a domestic violence crime he was sexually abused by one of his inmates. In Anderson&rsquo;s case, his upbringing was plagued with violence and alcoholism, while McKinney suffered serious addiction problems after the death of his mother. &nbsp;It is the murderer&rsquo;s tumultuous pasts that also make these cases so similar.</p>
<p>
	Both Jorge Steven and Matt were portrayed as drug users. &nbsp; The fact that it was rumored that Jorge Steven engaged in prostitution generated a sense of moral confision and debate in the community. &nbsp;This issue adds even more complexity to the case. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In Matt&#39;s case, shortly after the savage beating, it was discovered that the boy was HIV positive and an acquaintance of Matt stated that he had expressed his desire to commit suicide.</p>
<p>
	All these elements turn both into events full of social questions and vague justifications of the killers&rsquo; behavior. They both raise doubts, also, amongst those who hold religious and moral points of view, which at times have more weight in our society than violence itself.</p>
<p>
	Gay Panic Defense</p>
<p>
	The &quot;gay panic defense&quot; is a legal defense that seeks to establish that the murderer had a lapse of insanity tied to a state of violence that led to perpetrate the attack. The genesis of this defense tactic stems from a weak psychiatric defense theory outlined by Dr. Edward J. Kempf in 1920.</p>
<p>
	The theory states that the perpetrator suffers from psychosis that generates brief hallucinations and violent reactions and accuses the victim of homosexual acts.</p>
<p>
	Notwithstanding, this defense has not been brought up in a homogeneous and solid &nbsp;manner in the various fora of the United States in which they have been raised.</p>
<p>
	Aaron McKinney raised this defense in court arguing that he beat Matt because Matt patted his thigh in the direction of his genitals, but the court rejected the argument.</p>
<p>
	In Martinez&#39;s case, his &nbsp;statements adhere to the same defense. The alleged murderer said the memory of the incident at the prison led him to perpetrate such a cruel act when he realized that Jorge Steven was a man and not a woman. It remains to be seen if defense lawyers will use the argument in local courts.</p>
<p>
	Despite the extensive overlap in the circumstances surrounding the cases and the moral and religious arguments that undermine the events, there has also been a positive side: the reaction of the press and the community to a crime of these dimensions. Both in the case of Matt as in Jorge Steven, media coverage has been intense, and the gay community in general has spilled over into expressions of repudiation of such crimes through demonstrations, marches and vigils.</p>
<p>
	In short, both the positives and negatives of &nbsp;the reactionary behavior that generated these sad but important events, help to give a homogeneous hue to the analysis in order to understand that the prejudice and public discussions are in fact very similar both communities.</p>

They do so in ways that are intended to create memory and forgetting. In the case of the brutal murder of Jorge Steven L&oacute;pez Mercado, the sheer excess of violence, in which the body was dismembered, decapitated and partially burnt, seems intended to impair remembrance by making it painful to contemplate, at the same time as it is impossible to forget. As far as is yet known, Jorge Steven encountered the killer Juan Jos&eacute; Mart&iacute;nez Matos while engaged in sex work. At this time Jorge Steven was wearing drag. I use these circumlocutions because there is now a considerable debate within Puerto Rico and activist circles as to the correct designation of his identity, ranging from gay to transgender. Such debates indicate that the work of violence has not failed to disrupt and disturb. While the case has been reported in LGBT publications, it has received little mainstream coverage in the US, contrasting with the Matthew Shepard case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<span>When I heard about the crime, it recalled the 1757 <a href=""http://foucault.info/documents/disciplineAndPunish/foucault.disciplineAndPunish.torture.en.html"">execution of the regicide Damiens</a> made famous by Michel Foucault, in which the body of the condemned was dismembered and tortured under a multiple logic. First it repaired the offence against the &ldquo;body politic,&rdquo; the second of the &ldquo;<a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=8ItLMTU38rEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=king%27s+two+bodies&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bqspU2bLo9&amp;sig=T3h30pPDaOe4vnpVIKEc5Y3V4xo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GXGMS6HbKoXp8Qay76WSDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f"">King&rsquo;s Two Bodies</a>,&rdquo; as Ernst Kantorowicz memorably described medieval monarchy. In this sense, violence meted out by the law renders the social situation equal by matching one act with another to return to stability. Next, it was intended to save the soul of the offender by reconciling him with the Church, the <i>amende honorable</i>. Finally, it served as a warning to those still living not to contemplate any similar act. While these acts were certainly torture, they were not intended as the products of hate so much as those of the terrible love manifested by the church militant and its secular arm, the monarchy. In short, Damiens&rsquo; execution was spectacular but, far from being meaningless, for its the violence was saturated with meanings.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
	<span>Does this parallel have any purchase in this case? The killer would seem to have had no official legal sanction. Yet much of the outrage in activist circles since the murder stems from the equivocations by certain politicians and police officers in Puerto Rico and the silence of Governor Luis Fortu&ntilde;o. It seems inconceivable that such a murder would be ignored or excused if the victim were not identified as LGBT. By the same token, however, the extreme degree of violence used has generated a certain extra degree of attention to the case both on the island and within the US. One can conclude that the dismemberment was intended as a message of some kind. Indeed, had the case been less spectacular, it is likely that it would not have been prosecuted as quickly by the police. That is to say, the excess violence cannot be attributed to a desire to escape prosecution.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
	<span>Indeed, it seems likely that the defense to be mounted by the admitted killer may involve some form of claim regarding so-called &ldquo;homosexual panic&rdquo; as used in the Matthew Shepard trial. While Mart&iacute;nez Matos was accepted by a state psychiatrist as capable of standing trial, the question of homosexual panic may yet recur because the standard used to determine this issue is simply the ability to distinguish right from wrong. The &ldquo;homosexual panic&rdquo; quasi-diagnosis was <a href=""http://www.aglp.org/gap/timeline.htm"">first proposed</a> by the American analyst Edward Kempf in his <i>Psychopathology</i>&nbsp; (1921) from where it made its way into the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</i>&nbsp; (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) in 1952. Subsequent editions of the DSM did not include homosexual panic and the APA deleted homosexuality itself as a disorder from the DSM-II in 1973. The 1980 DSM-III created a new class of &ldquo;psychosexual disorders,&rdquo; including gender identity disorder (transsexualism), and &ldquo;ego-dystonic homosexuality.&rdquo; The current 1994 DSM-IV makes an unlikely grouping of sexual dysfunction, the paraphilias, and gender identity disorder under the heading &ldquo;sexual and gender identity disorders.&rdquo; Much controversy surrounds the on-going revision of these diagnoses. Were gender identity to be removed, for instance, insurance would be likely to refuse to pay for gender reassignment surgery. Given this confusing psychiatric context, it would relatively easy for a lawyer to suggest &ldquo;homosexual panic&rdquo; as a mitigating factor, without having to specify precisely its meaning.</span></p>
<p>
	<span>It is surely unlikely that Mart&iacute;nez Matos, known locally as &ldquo;Casper,&rdquo; was thinking ahead to such an elaborate defense strategy. It turns out that his father is a butcher, a trade that he may also share. In the chilling forensic photograph that &ldquo;somehow&rdquo; found its way onto the Internet, it was apparent that the person who dismembered Jorge Steven knew what he was doing. </span>The limbs were neatly and cleanly separated, not hacked apart. <!--EndFragment--><span>Whatever the nature of the encounter, it seems likely that Casper felt himself interpellated by what Lacan called the &ldquo;law of the father.&rdquo; In a public statement he has declared: &ldquo;Forgive me, dad, forgive me. I picked up that boy from Padial street and killed him downstairs [bajos de tu casa] in your house.&rdquo;</span><span> </span><span>The phrase &ldquo;bajos de tu casa&rdquo; is ambiguous but as Carmen Oquendo-Villar commented to me: &ldquo;the son was physically under the father while performing the act. Not just inside of the father&rsquo;s house, but right under him.&rdquo; The desire to be under the father, to be possessed by the father, articulates itself through violence. The biological father blends imperceptibly into God the Father, who subjugates, orders and dominates from above.<br />
	</span></p>
<p>
	<span>Lacan specified that the gaze is a structure whereby one feels looked at from outside, regardless of the physical presence of others. If, as is claimed, the encounter between Casper and Jorge Steven took place in the father&rsquo;s house, it would appear that the trans-gressive act against the law of the father was at once answered by the jealous patriarch(y). That is to say, the killer felt himself looked at by the father that he had internalized and felt required to punish his own sexual act. The violence was a restitution of the law to which the subject feels allegiance but cannot fully perform. Its excess and the proper performance of butchery, the father&rsquo;s trade, were components of the revenge required by the law and the (re)establishment of sexual difference as a gendered, normative binary.</span></p>
<p>
	<span>I venture this interpretation not to excuse Mart&iacute;nez Matos or to diminish the horror of what was done but to suggest that the act was far from random or meaningless. There is a sense in which Mart&iacute;nez Matos was also a victim of his own (father&rsquo;s) homophobia. It connects the violence to sovereignty, as in the case of Damiens, but via the domesticated animal, who is the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; object of butchery, not to mention vivisection.The purpose of the domestic animal is to be slaughtered. There is here a distinction to be made between the domesticated animal, raised in order to be killed, and the wild animal that may or may not be hunted, according to complex codes of what is permitted to be eaten, when it may be killed and how. It is further distinguished from the &ldquo;companion species,&rdquo; such as dogs and cats. </span></p>
<p>
	<span>In his recently translated seminar <i>The Beast and the Sovereign</i> (2001-2), Jacques Derrida pointed out that the animal and the sovereign are both outside the law: &ldquo;in a becoming-beast of the sovereign or in a becoming-sovereign of the beast, the passage from the one to the other, the analogy, the resemblance, the alliance, the hymen depending on the fact that they both share that very singular position of being outlaws, above or at a distance from the law&rdquo; (32). The sovereignty in play here is a fusion of that &ldquo;petty sovereignty&rdquo; discerned by Judith Butler in her analysis of Guant&aacute;namo Bay and the classic definition of sovereignty as the power to withdraw life, brought together in the figure of the keeper of livestock. In killing, Casper asserted his right as a petty sovereign of heteronormativity to withdraw life . By butchering his victim, Casper asserted sovereignty and patriarchy while &ldquo;rendering&rdquo; his victim an animal, to use a technical term for the industrialized production of meat. There is here a distinction to be made between the domesticated animal, raised in order to be killed, and the wild animal that may or may not be hunted, according to complex codes of what is permitted to be eaten, when it may be killed and how.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
	The connection in this affair is not with Damiens but with the abuses of Abu Ghraib in 2004. Lyndie England, the young woman who became the symbol of the affair, had previously worked in a chicken-rendering plant in West Virginia, where the animals were routinely sexually and physically abused. In Iraq, the prisoners were described as &ldquo;animals&rdquo; over and again by their guards and were forced to perform &ldquo;homosexuality&rdquo; as evidence of their bestiality. In a performative circle, the abusers of animals turned their prisoners into &ldquo;animals&rdquo; by making them appear to be &ldquo;unnatural&rdquo; and therefore worthy of slaughter.</p>
<p>
	<span>This logic is very much at work in present-day jurisprudence. In his <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZD.html"">dissent</a> to <i>Lawrence</i> v. <i>Texas</i> (2003), in which the remaining state laws criminalizing &ldquo;sodomy&rdquo; were invalidated by the US Supreme Court, Justice Antonin Scalia ventured to assert that the consequence would be the legalization of bestiality, not to mention incest, adultery, bigamy and other offences against the law of the father. This theme has been picked up by anti-marriage equality activists, playing a part in their surprisingly successful populist campaigns. Fear, as Hobbes long ago argued, is central to sovereignty and its deployment. In part that fear is fear of sovereignty, of its outlaw status, its bestiality. Sovereign homophobia, the rendering animal, restoration of order: these are the performances required and enacted from the Supreme Court to the local murder in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</span></p>
<p>
	<span>Without exploring the growing sovereign claims of the Supreme Court, it is important to note how even the word &ldquo;sovereignty&rdquo; is controversial in Puerto Rico. Following a presentation by former Governor Anibal Acevedo-Vil&aacute;, the United Nations Decolonization Committee <a href=""http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2008/gacol3176.doc.htm""><span>ruled</span></a> in June 2008 that the US should &ldquo;expedite a process that would allow the Puerto Rican people fully to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence,&rdquo; release all political prisoners and restore Vieques Island to civilian control. Curiously Acevedo-Vil&agrave; was indicted on federal corruption charges at this time, contributing to the election of the current Republican governor Fortu&ntilde;o in November 2008. More curiously still, Acevedo-Vil&agrave; was found not guilty of all charges in March 2009, some fifteen of the 24 counts having been dismissed by the judge before trial.&nbsp; Sovereignty issues have now been shelved and a <a href=""http://www.prdailysun.com/news/Fortuo-proposes-ban-on-same-sex-marriage""><span>constitutional ban on gay marriage</span></a> (in addition to the current legal prohibition) was proposed by Fortu&ntilde;o in January 2010. None of these comments excuse Acevedo-Vil&agrave; from accusations of corruption, which seems endemic to the internal politics of the island. These issues are rarely reported in the United States in order to maintain the &ldquo;fit of absence of mind&rdquo; (to quote J.R. Seeley&#39;s aphorism on the British empire) in which the Republic remains an empire.</span></p>
<p>
	When Jorge Steven made the poor decision to get into Casper&rsquo;s car, none of this was in his mind or that of his john, who became his killer. But that intersection was always already potentially fatal, an expression of the sovereign fear that has dominated the United States since 2001. Nor is the violence only &ldquo;peripheral&rdquo; or remote. In December 2008, Jos&eacute; Sucuzha&ntilde;ay, an Ecuadorean immigrant, was <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/17/opinion/17wed3.html?_r=1"">murdered in Brooklyn</a>, apparently because his assailants assumed he was gay. Routinely ignored, routinely mitigated as the act of bad apple(s), such violence is by now routine, the very fabric of everyday life in the present crisis. As much as we want to look away or look elsewhere, everyday violence demands our everyday attention.</p>",NULL,NULL,NULL,"1168, 1172, 1169, 1167, 1171, 1170",NULL,NULL

	Like Matthew Shepard&rsquo;s, Jorge Steven&rsquo;s body is generating its own mythical force. The body of the young American man whose name heads the Hate Crime Act recently signed by President Obama was found almost dead in a field in Laramie, Wyoming. His face so brutally beaten by two young men, that those who found him thought they were staring at a scarecrow. Matthew was murdered for being homosexual. The defense lawyers for the self-confessed killers alleged the accused were victims of &ldquo;gay panic.&rdquo; Jorge Steven, a 19-year-old, was murdered by another young man, Juan Jos&eacute; Martinez Matos, who allegedly paid Jorge (or not) to engage in sex. That encounter ended with the savage murder of this young man, whose body was stabbed, dismembered, partially burnt, and then dumped in Mount Guavate in Cayey. Juan Jos&eacute;, the self-confessed killer, has said Jorge Steven tricked him supposedly posing as a woman the night of the encounter. Matthew was murdered for being who he was. Jorge Steven was murdered allegedly for not being who he claimed to be.</p>
<p>
	<span><b>Two beautiful young gay men heinously murdered. Like Matthew&rsquo;s body in the United States, Jorge Steven&rsquo;s body is a prominent icon in the struggle for gay rights in Puerto Rico at a moment when the gay marriage issue is gaining decisive momentum in many parts of Europe, some Latin American countries, and a handful of American states. The possibility of Juan Jos&eacute; being prosecuted under the hate crimes law would restore some dignity in the Puerto Rican LGBT population. A crucial point is that Jorge Steven&rsquo;s dead body is essential for the vindication of the homosexual bodies alive in the country today. For this to happen, it&rsquo;s important that we identify the real victim of this crime. The victim is not the murderer, as those who use the &ldquo;gay panic&rdquo; defense claim, but the homosexual who has been murdered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p>
	<span><b>The process of victimizing Jorge Steven&rsquo;s body has been unraveling for the last few months in Puerto Rico with a clarity, consequence and determination never before seen. Similar crimes committed against homosexuals during the decades of the seventies and eighties, like the case of Ivan Frontera -- murdered by a serial killer commonly known as the &ldquo;Angel of Single Men&rdquo; &ndash; never generated news that traveled beyond gossip and tabloid press dedicated to crimes of passion. The only effect caused by the death of Ivan Frontera, a fashion and social etiquette journalist, was the termination of &ldquo;Ivan Fontecha&rdquo;, a popular television character spoofing the flamboyant mannerisms of Frontera, created by comedian Sunshine Logro&ntilde;o, who removed the character from his repertoire. Ironically, with this gesture Logro&ntilde;o denied Frontera his last chance of survival.</b></span></p>
<p>
	<span><b>But Jorge Steven&rsquo;s case has been quite different. News about his death and the prosecution of his killer, still at an early stage, have been widely covered by the local press, and there have been attempts to place the news in a global context. Commemorative vigils have taken place in Puerto Rico and New York, there are numerous testimonial videos by friends and admirers on YouTube, and several film memorials have been created celebrating the life of Jorge Steven with photos, anecdotes. and statements from activists in Puerto Rico and the United States.</b></span></p>
<p>
	<span><b>No one has been more faithfully dedicated to this cause than Pedro Julio Serrano, who has practically turned Jorge Steven&rsquo;s murder into the axis of his position as the leading LGBT rights activist in Puerto Rico. Currently working as communications manager of the National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce, a leading national lobbying organization working at the federal level, Pedro Julio ran for legislator under the New Progressive Party a few years ago without success. He since has become a fierce advocate for gay marriage and constitutional equality for sexual minorities. No one explains with more eloquence and zest the due right we gay people have to be treated with absolute equality as legitimate citizens of a Puerto Rican society that must be for everyone once and for all. That&rsquo;s the name of his base organization: Puerto Rico for Every@ne (Puerto Rico para Tod@s). In Spanish, the word everyone has a masculine and feminine form, and he uses the @ symbol to include both genres in a single grammatical space.</b></span></p>
<p>
	<span><b>The day of Jorge Steven&rsquo;s wake at Diaz Funeral Home in Toa Alta, my partner and I attended along with some friends. Like so many others, his death had moved us deeply and we felt compelled to be there as part of the LGBT community of our country. Chapel A, a small and humble space, was packed with family and friends. Some of us had to remain standing by the entrance. Soon after we arrived, Pedro Julio showed up and sat on the floor in front of a makeshift altar with numerous photos of Jorge Steven and his friends. One of Jorge Steven&rsquo;s brothers introduced the preacher for the event, a woman between the age of 30 and 40, who introduced herself as a former addict transformed by the word of God. In her testimony she told us how her addiction caused her to become homeless and hand her children over to the government. The process of her transformation that began with her religious encounter, allowed her to start a new life re-socialized, a life for which she claimed back her sons. Her two sons, who went to live with her again, were present at the funeral home. She asked them to join her up front and proudly introduced them as her two gay sons. Her testimony ended on a dramatic note: she had to leave her congregation because of her sons&rsquo; homosexuality. Her church accepted her, but they couldn&rsquo;t accept her gay sons. At the end of her testimony many of the people in the room were moved to tears.</b></span></p>
<p>
	<span><b>After this first act, it was Pedro Julio&rsquo;s turn. His words were firm and moving. &ldquo;The sin is not homosexuality. The sin is homophobia. The sin is intolerance, it&rsquo;s the violence of silence.&rdquo; Pedro Julio uses religious language, not like a religious figure, but like a politician. When he uses the word &ldquo;sin&rdquo; he&rsquo;s referring to the fault, the problem, the issue. &ldquo;The silence of the politicians (continues) who have not even expressed their condolences to Jorge Steven&rsquo;s mom, is a deafening silence. Some days ago I witnessed another silence at a gay club were they observed a minute of silence in memory of Jorge Steven. A minute of silence at a club&hellip;Two silences, so different one from the other.&rdquo; I thought to myself, a minute of silence in a gay club, that&rsquo;s a true miracle.&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p>
	<span><b>Pedro Julio Serrano has the qualities to be a great political figure in his native country. He speaks with conviction. He speaks with a clear sense of purpose, and has a genuine and utterly important message. Jorge Steven&rsquo;s death, so unfortunate and untimely, could, however, be key for people to get a better and deeper understanding of the interesting and promising Pedro Julio. His young and candid style, never trivial nor entitled, presents him as a different kind of contender in the Puerto Rican political arena, so deteriorated in recent years by dimwitted politicians produced by long-standing and tired partisan politics. I hope that figures like Pedro Julio and especially our voters come to realize that our political future does not lie in political parties. We have to listen to the proposals of minority groups like homosexuals, women, syndicates, and environmentalists. The advocates for Corredor Ecol&oacute;gico del Noreste, Todo Puerto Rico por Puerto Rico, Movimiento Hostosiano, and Puerto Rico para Tod@s. Therein lies the future of Puerto Rican politics. Neither (former governor) Anibal Acevedo, nor (current mayor of San Juan) Santini, (current governor) Fortu&ntilde;o, (current president of the Senate) Rivera Shatz, or (former senator) Ruben Berrios have much to offer Puerto Rico. But figures like Pedro Julio Serrano do. The famous kiss he and his boyfriend shared at the end of his deposition in front of the Legislature is one of the few promising political acts that have taken place in this grand house in recent years.</b></span></p>
<p>
	<span><b>However, and I say this not with arrogance but with certain melancholy, neither Pedro Julio, nor the gay community, or LGBT activism have the capacity to summon Jorge Steven&rsquo;s real body. In a way, there&rsquo;s no greater act of violence against a body than placing it in the sarcophagus of victimization. On the other hand, I recognize it&rsquo;s true, even if I don&rsquo;t completely accept it: we had to snatch the young body away from the murderer, we had to remove him from his hands, so he couldn&rsquo;t continue dismembering him. We had to restitute him into an integral body, a united body, coherent, legible, a body that could restitute itself for law and order, a complete body waiting to be re-civilized. That is the body of a victim of a hate crime. In order for the victim to occupy his space, it&#39;s necessary for the perpetrator to occupy his. The assignment of roles in the cast of this drama is implacable. And the stage lights have to shine on the body remembered (rememorized and reunified), the body of the new political subject of the XXI century: the LGBT body.</b></span></p>
<p>
	<span><b>The drama woven in this process is about gay rights. It&rsquo;s an important drama. I&rsquo;m moved by the progress we&rsquo;ve had in Spain, Holland, Vermont. I&rsquo;m moved by Evo Morales&rsquo; pro-gay policies. But I can&rsquo;t forget that the two main causes of the gay movement in the United States today, gay marriage and serving openly in the military, we should admit, are very conservative. The right to marriage is in fact the right to divorce. The number of gay couples that divorce soon after getting married is alarming. We have become staunch advocates attempting to save two of the most questionable institutions of Western society: bourgeoisie marriage and the imperial army.&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p>
	<span><b>That&rsquo;s why my melancholy cannot be satisfied with the victimized body of Jorge Steven representing the gay movement. It&rsquo;s obvious that the impact of his body on his murderer is far more outrageous than the degree of hate as defined by the penal code. What did Juan Jos&eacute; really want to kill? What did he want to erase with a knife, with fire, and dismemberment? An act that instead of vanishing the body, multiplied it, recomposed it, and increased it, in a geometrical progression. A body that far from disappearing, spreads over Mount Guavate, grows, and comes apart to incriminate from the darkest places of the forest. What did Juan Jos&eacute; attempted to kill but failed?</b></span></p>
<p>
	<span><b>Of the many testimonials about Jorge Steven circulating on YouTube and in the press, the gay movement has focused on those that present him as a good boy, hard working, obedient, full of happiness and hunger for life. His mother talks about his generous nature. Some friends even draw him as a little angel. It&rsquo;s as if the victim, in order to be effective, has to become a good girl, a sweet stay-at-home Barbie. But there are other testimonials on YouTube, many from his disco drag friends who have dedicated some let&rsquo;s-call-it-a-night performances to him. There&rsquo;s April, Queen Bee Ho, and the drag that sings for him &ldquo;Wind Beneath My Wings&rdquo; by Bette Midler in the most dignified way. At the end of the song she invites the audience in the club to join her in a minute of silence (the same Pedro Julio speaks about). But the best is yet to come. As soon as the minute expires, she gives a clownish conspiratorial look to her audience and lets out a thunderous scream &ldquo;Here we go, let&rsquo;s do it the way he liked it, let us be heard all the way up in heaven, pu&ntilde;eta!&rdquo; In another of my favorite videos, a young friend dedicates a testimonial to him using his cherished pictures to the beat of &ldquo;Bad Romance&rdquo; by Lady Gaga, with its frantic non-stop chorus: Work It Homo Freak Bitch!&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p>
	<span><b>It&rsquo;s in Jorge Steven&rsquo;s pictures that his true body appears to me, his fierce body. His plump red lips, his hair (flaming red is my favorite), his plucked eyebrows, striking a pose with two fingers framing an eye. It&rsquo;s obvious that Jorge Steven was no Little Red Riding Hood. He was the Alpha Bitch of a fierce pack of bitches. That&rsquo;s the body that his murderer tried to vanish. The body of desire. His desire. But he only was able to tear it apart and multiply it. A body that becomes animal. A body that becomes female. A fascinating, powerful, and dangerous body</b></span><span>.</span></p>
<p>
	<span><b>The gay struggle has become a project of liberal politics: the quest for equality. Equal rights. Thus, inserting itself in the civil rights movement, the biggest contribution of liberal politics in the West. But our political struggle doesn&rsquo;t fade in the search for equality. Its most radical form is in fact the defense of the differences. The body that provokes fear because it fascinates and confuses at the same time, is the body of the differences. A body that is neither female, nor male. It&rsquo;s a trans body. The real phobia is ultimately not homophobia. It&rsquo;s trans phobia, the phobia of a borderline body, porous, a multiple body in constant transformation, like a fierce pack of queens. That is the legitimate political body that we must defend&hellip;even from civil rights politics. A naked, impudent, explosive body. A homo freak bitch.&nbsp;<o p=""""></o></b></span></p>

	How important are small written ephemera such as notes, especially now that we create an almost incalculable number of them on digital services such as Twitter? Ever since the Library of Congress surprised many with&nbsp;<a href=""http://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2010/04/how-tweet-it-is-library-acquires-entire-twitter-archive/"" style=""text-decoration: none; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); "">its announcement</a>&nbsp;that it would accession the billions of public tweets since 2006, the subject has been one of significant debate. Critics lamented what they felt was a lowering of standards by the library&mdash;a trendy, presentist diversion from its national mission of saving historically valuable knowledge. In their minds, Twitter is a mass of worthless and mundane musings by the unimportant, and thus obviously unworthy of an archivist&rsquo;s attention. The humorist Andy Borowitz summarized this cultural critique in a mocking headline: &ldquo;<a href=""http://twitter.com/BorowitzReport/status/12180322899"" style=""text-decoration: none; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); "">Library of Congress to Acquire Entire Twitter Archive; Will Rename Itself &lsquo;Museum of Crap.&rsquo;</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 12px; "">
	Few readers of this blog will be surprised to find that I take a rather different view of the matter. How could we not want to preserve a vast record of everyday life and thoughts from tens of millions of people, however mundane? (For more on my views of the Twitter/Library of Congress debate, and to inflate my ego, please consult articles from the&nbsp;<em><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/business/02digi.html"" style=""text-decoration: none; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); "">New York Times</a></em>, the&nbsp;<em><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/05/AR2010050505309.html"" style=""text-decoration: none; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); "">Washington Post</a></em>, and&nbsp;<em><a href=""http://www.slate.com/id/2251429"" style=""text-decoration: none; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); "">Slate</a></em>.)</p>

	As any practicing historian knows, some of the most critical collections of primary sources are ephemera that someone luckily saved for the future. For example, historians of the English Civil War are deeply thankful that&nbsp;<span>Humphrey Bartholomew had the presence of mind to save 50,000 pamphlets (once considered throwaway pieces of hack writing) from the seventeenth century and give them to a library at Oxford.&nbsp;</span>Similarly, I recently discovered during a behind-the-scenes tour of the Cambridge University Library that the library&rsquo;s off-limits tower, long rumored by undergraduates to be filled with pornography, is actually stocked with old genre fiction such as Edwardian spy novels. (See photographic evidence, below.) Undoubtedly the librarians of 1900 were embarrassed by the stuff; today, social historians and literary scholars can rejoice that they didn&rsquo;t throw these cheap volumes out. As I have argued in this space,&nbsp;<em>scholars have uses for archives that archivists cannot anticipate</em>.</p>

<p style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 12px; "">
	But let me set aside for a moment my optimistic disposition about the Twitter archive and instead meet the critics halfway. Suppose that we really don&rsquo;t know if the archive will be useful or not&mdash;or worse, perhaps we are relatively sure it will be utterly worthless. Does that necessarily mean that the Library or Congress should not have accessioned it? I was thinking about this fair-minded version of the &ldquo;What to save?&rdquo; conundrum recently when I remembered a penetrating article about criminal profiling, which, of all things, helpfully reveals the correct calculus about the importance of digital ephemera such as tweets.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 12px; text-align: center; "">
	* * *</p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 12px; "">
	The act of stopping certain air travelers for additional checks&mdash;to give them more costly attention&mdash;is a difficult task riven by conflicting theories of whom to check and (as mathematicians know) associated search algorithms. Do utterly random checks work best? Should the extra searches focus on certain groups or certain bits of information (one-way tickets, cash purchases)? Many on the right (which is also home, I suspect, to many of the critics who scoff at the Twitter archive) believe in strong profiling&mdash;that is, spending nearly the entire budget and time of the Transportation Security Administration profiling Middle Easterners and Muslims. Many on the left counter that this strong profiling leads to insidious stereotyping.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 12px; "">
	A more powerful critique of strong profiling was advanced last year by the computational statistician&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.nr.com/whp/"" style=""text-decoration: none; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); "">William Press</a>&nbsp;in &ldquo;<a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0813202106"" style=""text-decoration: none; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); "">Strong Profiling is Not Mathematically Optimal for Discovering Rare Malfeasors</a>&rdquo; (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2009). Press acknowledges that the issue of profiling (whether for terrorists at the airport or for criminals in a traffic stop) has enormous social and political implications. But he seeks to answer a more basic question: does strong profiling actually work? Or is there a more optimal mathematical formula for spending scarce time and resources to achieve the desired outcome?</p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 12px; "">
	Press examines two idealized mathematical cases. The first, the &ldquo;authoritarian&rdquo; strategy, assumes that we have perfect surveillance of society and precisely know the odds that someone will be a criminal (and thus worthy of additional screening). The second, the &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; strategy, assumes that our knowledge of people is messy and incomplete. In that case of imperfect information the mathematics is much more complex, because we can&rsquo;t assign a reliable probability of criminality to each person and then give them security attention at an intensity commensurate to that value. It turns out that in the democratic case, the fuzzier mathematics strongly suggest a broader range of attention.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 12px; "">
	Moreover, even beyond the obvious fact that that the democratic model is closest to real life,&nbsp;<em>the democratic algorithm for profiling is better than the authoritarian model, even if that state of omnipotent knowledge was achievable</em>. Even if we had Minority Report-style knowledge, or even if we believed that the universe of potential criminals was entirely a subset of a particular group, it would be unwise to fully rely on this knowledge. To do so would lead to &ldquo;oversampling,&rdquo; an inefficient overemphasis on particular individuals. Of course we should pay attention to those with the maximum probability of being a criminal. But we also have to mix into our algorithm some attention to those who are seemingly innocent to achieve the best outcome&mdash;to stop the most crimes.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 12px; "">
	Through some mathematics we need not get into here, Press concludes that the optimal formula for paying attention to subjects is to avoid using the straight probability that each person is a criminal and instead use the square root of that value. For instance, if you feel Person A is 100 times more likely to be a terrorist than Person B, you should spend 10 times, not 100 times, the resources on Person A over Person B. Moreover, as our certainty about potential suspects decreases, the democratic sampling model&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/106/6/1716/F1.expansion.html"" style=""text-decoration: none; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); "">becomes increasingly more efficient</a>&nbsp;compared to the authoritarian model.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 12px; "">
	Although couched in the language of crime prevention, what Press is really talking about is&nbsp;<em>the calculus of importance</em>. As Press himself notes, &ldquo;The idea of sampling by square-root probabilities is quite general and can have many other applications.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 12px; text-align: center; "">
	* * *</p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 12px; "">
	As it turns out, the calculus of importance is the same for the Transportation Security Administration and for the Library of Congress. Press&rsquo;s conclusions apply directly to the archivist&rsquo;s dilemma of how to spend limited resources on saving objects in a digital age. The criminals in our library scenario are people or documents likely to be important to future researchers; innocents are those whom future historians will find uninteresting. Additional screening is the act of archiving&mdash;that is, selection for greater attention.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 12px; "">
	What does this mean for the archiving of digital emphemera such as status updates&mdash;those little, seemingly worthless online notes? It means we should continue to expend the majority of resources on those documents and people of most likely future interest, but not to the exclusion of objects and figures that currently seem unimportant.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 12px; "">
	In other words, if you believe that the notebooks of a known writer are likely to be 100 times more important to future historians and researchers than the blog of a nobody, you should spend 10, not 100, times the resources in preserving those notebooks over the blog. It&rsquo;s still a considerable gap, but much less than the traditional (authoritarian) model would suggest. The calculus of importance thus implies that libraries and archives should consciously pursue contents such as those in the Cambridge University Library tower, even if they feel it runs counter to common sense.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 12px; "">
	So even if the skeptics are right and the Twitter archive is a boondoggle for the Library of Congress, it is the correct kind of bet on the future value of digital ephemera, the equivalent of the TSA spending 10% of their budget to examine more closely threats other than those posed by twentysomething Arabs.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 12px; "">
	The accessioning of the Twitter archive by the Library of Congress is not an expensive affair. Tweets are small digital objects, and even billions of them fit on a few cheap drives. Even with digital asset management, IT labor across time, and electricity costs, storing billions of tweets is economical, especially compared to the cost of storing physical books. University of Michigan Librarian Paul Courant&nbsp;<a href=""http://shapeofthings.org/papers/PCourant.docx"" style=""text-decoration: none; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); "">has calculated</a>&nbsp;[Word doc] that the present value of the cost to store a book on library shelves in perpetuity is about $100 (mostly in physical plant costs). An equivalent electronic text costs just $5.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px; font-size: 12px; "">
	This vast disparity only serves to reinforce the calculus of importance and archival imperatives of institutions such as the Library of Congress. The library and other keepers of our cultural heritage should be doing much more to save the digital ephemera of our age, no matter what we contemporaries think of these scrawls on the web. You never know when a historian will pan a bit of gold out of that seemingly worthless stream.</p>

The Internet context enhances note-taking practice with unprecedented usability: studying film by creating online notes in a pathway &ldquo;notebook&rdquo; was applauded by students at Queen Mary, University of London, who have utilised SP-ARK and its pathway feature as part of an undergraduate course on adaptation. This project involved the students exploring the archive assets and creating their own pathways about Potter&rsquo;s adaptation of Woolf&rsquo;s novel. The students commented that the pathway tool was innovative, simple to use, and most of all, an effective note-taking tool due to its linear structure. The students explained that this type of structure is most effective for essay planning since it allows for a step-by-step accumulation of notes which then become a detailed plan, and in this particular task, formed the basis of their assessed essays.&nbsp;</span></span></font></p>

Using the website as part of his teaching, Dr Charles Drazin (Queen Mary) found that the pathways &ldquo;facilitated the provision of on-going feedback as students worked on their assignment in a way that is not feasible in traditional coursework.&rdquo; He added that the pathway feature of SP-ARK &ldquo;is at the core of what is valuable and innovative about the site&rdquo; precisely for its note-taking opportunities by allowing his students to build their ideas around the assets in the archive and create a living and ongoing discussion about them.</span></span></font></p>

Vicki Callahan of UW-Milwaukee and USC refers to the pathways as allowing the user to leave a &ldquo;research trail&rdquo; that simultaneously immerses the user in the archive artefacts, yet also &ndash; through note-taking and collaborative note-taking &ndash; creates new historical artefacts since the commentary and discussion about each archive asset remains a permanent feature of the site.</span></span></font></p>

The pathways feature provides clear opportunities for social networking, and in this context, a significant form of modern note-taking that can actively contribute something valuable to discussion between film scholars. Yet much feedback requested further features, such as the option to make notes confidential if being used for formal assessment or private research, the ability to view multiple pathways, the option to export notes from pathways into a Word document and the opportunity to create group pathways.&nbsp;</span></span></font></p>

However, as is often the case with online communities and social networking, the issue of regulation is one that emerges. The moderation of user input is a challenge for any website that encourages user involvement and one which poses questions about overreliance and trust. However, I would assert that discussion and interaction is one of the underlying features of academia and these types of online teaching and learning platforms add another way in which students can engage with peers, teachers, academics and other users who share common interests. The danger of placing too much trust in interchanges with unfamiliar users is equivalent to the care and common sense we must all take when communicating with those we do not know personally. Within the concept of note-taking, I would assert that when used sensibly, online tools that create new opportunities for the accumulation of notes and ideas, should be embraced, yet acknowledged as just one of many ways that creative note-takers gather their ideas.</span></span></font></p>

	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">When I think of everyday lists bearing meaning, I remember my father agonizing over the grocery list.&nbsp; He was a member of the &ldquo;Greatest Generation&rdquo; who retired way too early, and the role of house-husband was ill fitting.&nbsp; Eventually, Dad occupied himself by turning any household chore into an existentially complex exercise.&nbsp; The grocery list morphed into a Herculean effort that reinforced his sense of identity as the man about the house. &nbsp;</span></p>

	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">Each item on the grocery list had to be compared to his pouch of coupons and then annotated with a brand name and a flag denoting whether he had a coupon for it.&nbsp; Then, the grocery list required a complete reorganization so that it flowed top to bottom in the same order in which the aisles of the grocery store were arranged.&nbsp; Once at the grocery store, heaven help the store manager if he had chosen that day to reorganize the aisles, throwing Dad&rsquo;s meticulous grocery list out of kilter.</span></p>

	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">Yes, Dad had issues as he aged.&nbsp; Even so, I wonder if he was not a bit ahead of his time when it came to turning the grocery list into an identity-management tool.&nbsp; Dad&rsquo;s grocery list produced a grammar and a syntax that reinforced a stable identity for him during a late 20</span><span style=""font: 8.0px 'Lucida Grande'; letter-spacing: 0.0px""><sup>th</sup></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px""> century that threw lots of changes at him that were well out of his control.&nbsp; My father was a most modern man in his 20</span><span style=""font: 8.0px 'Lucida Grande'; letter-spacing: 0.0px""><sup>th</sup></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px""> century view of the world.&nbsp; Yet, he engaged in a post-modern rhetorical exercise on an everyday basis.&nbsp; The grocery list allowed him to write his identity into everyday living.</span></p>

	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">In the early 21</span><span style=""font: 8.0px 'Lucida Grande'; letter-spacing: 0.0px""><sup>st</sup></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px""> century, the pace of change has picked up considerably and, as Michael Pollan has suggested, a sophisticated grammar of food is implicated in those changes from both a cultural, political and media standpoint.&nbsp; The rise of new food discourses such as &ldquo;eat local&rdquo; or &ldquo;slow food&rdquo; impinge on what items go on the grocery list &ndash; indeed, what story gets written in that list.&nbsp; Contemporary grocery lists differ from Dad&rsquo;s grocery lists in many ways.&nbsp; The explosive growth of food media in general and the mainstreaming of Food Network and food blogs specifically have broadened the array of culturally-derived foods finding their way onto the grocery list.&nbsp; Fast-food sushi can now be found in many grocery stores and even Wal-Mart, but I can vouch that Dad&rsquo;s grocery list never included nigiri and a seaweed salad.</span></p>

	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">I am fascinated by food as a rhetorical resource, artifact and commodity that is necessarily attended by discourse.&nbsp; Here, I want to consider just what&rsquo;s happening to the grocery list in a 21</span><span style=""font: 8.0px 'Lucida Grande'; letter-spacing: 0.0px""><sup>st</sup></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px""> century milieu of late capital, sustainability movements, farmer&rsquo;s markets, concerns over the industrialized food system and urban farming.&nbsp; The grocery list is increasingly a rhetorical artifact located at the intersection of these forces. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px 'Lucida Grande'"">
	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">A quick wander through the aisles of scholarly literature confirms my suspicion that even cultural critics find the grocery list a bit too everyday for scrutiny.&nbsp; A few social scientists have hypothesized on the disjuncture between intention &ndash; as represented by the grocery list &ndash; and behavior in the grocery store.&nbsp; A few hope to find something important about online grocery shopping, though the role of the classic grocery list seems a bit unsettled there &ndash; at least until the computer screen is on the refrigerator door.</span></p>

	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">It appears that only Jack Goody has considered the grocery list as a rhetorical artifact in itself in &ldquo;The Recipe, The Prescription and the Experiment.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet, even here Goody does not really focus on the grocery list, juxtaposing it against the recipe as a foreshadowing chapter in a modernist narrative in which culture easily replicates itself, allowing no deviations or creativity from a set norm.&nbsp; The grocery list is essentially a supporting player in his analysis, an outgrowth of the recipe and a marker of a predetermined future.&nbsp; You make a list, you buy stuff, then you cook the meal foreshadowed by that list of ingredients.</span></p>

	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">That view has the great advantage of being tidy in a most modern way.&nbsp; Yet, compare that with the quirky and post-modern <a href=""http://www.grocerylists.org""><span style=""text-decoration: underline ; letter-spacing: 0.0px color: #3508fd"">www.grocerylists.org</span></a>.&nbsp; Here, several years&rsquo; worth of&nbsp; &ldquo;found&rdquo; grocery lists paint a picture not of dinners flowing from recipes, but of individuals and families living their sometimes untidy lives.&nbsp; No orderly narrative exists here.&nbsp; Grocery lists represent the moment, lacks and desires of all kinds, from chickens to jewelry from Macy&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The collection shows the grocery list often more closely resembles performance art than modernist narrative.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px 'Lucida Grande'"">
	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">Perhaps that image of performance art captures both my father&rsquo;s agonistic grocery list and the average grocery list of the early 21</span><span style=""font: 8.0px 'Lucida Grande'; letter-spacing: 0.0px""><sup>st</sup></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px""> century.&nbsp; The grocery list is a text, one that is produced on an everyday basis.&nbsp; In a time of global, cultural change and the emergence of new food discourses, perhaps we should consider whether the grocery list provides an everyday opportunity to write an identity.&nbsp; This notion links several threads of Michel de Certeau&rsquo;s The Practice of Everyday Life: practices as rhetorical forms, cooking as one of those practices, and the importance of small acts of resistance built into and out of the elements of everyday life.&nbsp; The grocery list might take on a function of constitutive rhetoric &ndash; who we are, or at least who we are on a given day as we negotiate the complexity of industrial society and any desires we might have to resist it in some small fashion. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px 'Lucida Grande'"">
	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">With de Certeau as a lens, the grammar and syntax of the grocery list is the everyday plan for negotiating our way through the spaces and tactics of power.&nbsp; For instance, the grocery store is a space of industrial society; the garden a space we control. What&rsquo;s not on the list might be just as important as what is.&nbsp; My own list will not include beets despite my wife&rsquo;s passion for them.&nbsp; You will find them in our garden, so they do not count as a lack we depend on the grocery store and the industrial food chain to fulfill.&nbsp; The grocery list is both text and performance of who we are.&nbsp; My list will say &ldquo;Kashi&rdquo; -- not just &ldquo;cereal&rdquo; -- because I have adopted that brand as a means of eating a healthy breakfast and avoiding the artificially produced, vitamin-injected cereals from the major brands.&nbsp; Of course, that act of entering the brand name is also an act of co-production of the brand&rsquo;s meaning.&nbsp; As more people use their purchasing power as a replacement for political power, the grocery list is potentially a regular source of practicing that economic form of protest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Coffee&rdquo; on the list is merely a sign standing in for the purchase of &ldquo;fair trade&rdquo; beans.&nbsp; Yet, on my father&rsquo;s list, the only meaning &ldquo;coffee&rdquo; linked to was the coupon he pulled out of his pouch.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px 'Lucida Grande'"">
	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">The grocery list displays other post-modern qualities.&nbsp; Rather than a modernist narrative, grocery lists are intertextual in a multicultural world.&nbsp; Food discourses and food media (cable cooking shows, a never-ending stream of cookbooks, food blogs etc.) provide a wide range of rhetorical resources, and the grocery list provides a means for collecting and sorting those resources.&nbsp; I might prepare one &ldquo;eat local&rdquo; list for the farmer&rsquo;s market and another for the grocery store.&nbsp; I might choose to eat Indian or Middle Eastern tonight, and the grocery list mediates between recipes in a cookbook, what is available to me with my resources and just how adventurous I will be in tasting the other. &nbsp; I might take great care in preparing a list that will allow me to prepare a stir fry for dinner and essentially &ldquo;try on&rdquo; the trappings of a Chinese peasant without ever leaving my well-appointed kitchen.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px 'Lucida Grande'"">
	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">Because of its everyday nature, the grocery list has also blurred into everyday technology.&nbsp; Many web recipes provide the option of printing out a grocery list for a particular dish.&nbsp; In that sense, the technology takes on a deterministic tendency, reinscribing the modernist narrative of cultural control in the form of a grocery list.&nbsp; Deviations from such a list must be purposeful.&nbsp; Yet, technology also unsettles the tidy narrative in many ways.&nbsp; The grocery list also flows through the cell phone, both as text messages &ndash; &ldquo;get milk&rdquo; &ndash; as well as a medium for fine-tuning the grocery list and navigating a late capital milieu of overwhelming choice.&nbsp; Few shopping trips occur without this husband calling home to find out just what brand or particular formulation of this or that was intended in a spousely scrawl (did we want the high, medium or low fiber cereal or the &ldquo;crunchy&rdquo; version versus the merely &ldquo;crisp&rdquo;).&nbsp; Technology tends toward decentering the grocery list, here, eroding its role in a controlling narrative even further.&nbsp; When attended by technology, the grocery list is no more than a first draft of Goody&rsquo;s narrative. &nbsp;</span></p>

	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">Like so many everyday texts and practices, the grocery list carries more meaning than it presents at first blush.&nbsp; Its nuances might well escape even those making out the lists, its rhetorical import hiding beneath the veil of the everyday.</span></p>

	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">History is made when archives accession and &ldquo;process&rdquo;&mdash;as it is called&mdash;records of interest. One of the first steps in processing any collection is the removal of items hazardous to the records themselves. For the most part this means that the original boxes and folders are replaced with new, acid-free ones, but I can remember at least one case in which strips of nitrate film (combustible) needed to be removed, and another in which a sample of mineral hornblende or pitchblende (radioactive) had to be whisked away. These things happen. By far the most common hazard excised from within boxes and folders, though, is the paperclip. Like water, mold, insects, and war, paperclips are the enemies of archival preservation. Like water, mold, and insects, paperclips have no history. (Wars, as we know, have histories according in part to the archives that survive them.) A potential agent of rust, the paperclip is forever banished from the historical record wherever professional archivists hold sway. A paperclip is neither document nor document-able but slips unwanted into a barely discernable crack between the archive and museum. There is a bricks-and-mortar museum someplace in Britain devoted to the history of the pencil and one in Baltimore devoted to the history of the tampon, or so I&rsquo;ve been told, but no museum that I know of renders a history of the paperclip. There is no such thing.&nbsp;</span></p>

	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">As processing archivists well know, before a scourge of bent metal fasteners flooded the records of business and civil service in the later nineteenth century, potential agents of rust were already lurking. Straight pins, large and small, were sometimes used to connect sheets, which might alternatively be bundled with colored string (familiarly, &ldquo;red tape&rdquo;) and pigeonholed or otherwise sorted and arranged according to the reigning logics of bureaucratic labor. Pins damaged the historic fabric, one might say, pricking holes where paperclips would later press together without puncture. Offices using straight pins tacked pages as they tailored paperwork. These were incremental workaday acts that pointed doubly toward the phylogenies of paper&mdash;originally made of rags&mdash;and of files. The OED tells us that a file was once &ldquo;a string or wire, on which papers and documents [were] strung for preservation and reference.&rdquo; Pretty soon a file came to refer both to the string or wire and to the collection of pages so strung: certainly neither the first nor the last time that object and subject have emerged to semantic conflation. The word indenture offers a related case, since it referred first to a medieval legal agreement with its separate pages indented along one edge so that they fit together. Connecting became containing, as the things done to pages (materially) became the things done on them (linguistically) and then with them (instrumentally).</span></p>

	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">If straight pins, staples, and ring binders help to recall the original meaning of file by transecting the pages they collect, then they also help to evoke &ldquo;the managerial revolution&rdquo; of the late nineteenth century, whereby the modern corporation emerged to reshape the world economy it has since defined. Structural changes to labor and finance accompanied changes to the techniques of management. Modern offices hatched new genres, like the memo, and entailed new gender politics, welcoming women secretaries at the same time that they welcomed a raft of new business machines, everything from telephones and typewriters to the humble staple and paperclip. Vertical filing alone&mdash;file folders arranged in file cabinets&mdash;is said to have worked a revolution in bureaucracy, circa 1890. While students of big business know that corporate power tends to be consolidated according to the directional logics of vertical and horizontal integration, the years that I have spent trolling through archives have prompted an appreciation of additional micro-logics: Corporations may proceed by integration, but offices function according to enclosure and attachment. Folders and envelopes are differently instruments of enclosure, while paperclips and staples attach. These are micro-logics by which bureaucratic labor collects and connects; in short, these are the everyday techniques whereby bureaucracies know.</span></p>

The paperclip icon signifies attachment in the email program I usually use, though of course the act of sending an email attachment is far different than clipping sheets of paper together. One difference is temporal. Paper attachments can be composed after the documents to which they adhere&mdash;think of annotated coversheets&mdash;while paper enclosures necessarily antedate the missives that enclose them. Email attachments have reversed this clock. They work more like traditional enclosures, since you can&rsquo;t attach an electronic file to your email message unless the file already exists. But the biggest distinction to be drawn between old forms of attachment and new is probably that sheets clipped together can be pages of the same document or they can be different documents, but an email attachment is always a distinct entity. Bent steel paperclips harbor a sort of attachment theory in miniature, we might say, whereby a document negotiates its own identity as/and others. (The ugly &ldquo;as/and&rdquo; is key.) By contrast, an email attachment is always alien to the email that makes it one. Papers get clipped for storage and transmission, but email attachments exist only to be transmitted and unattached, unmade, undone. This may be what accounts for the beauty of these old paperclips, as I see them. Each was one of millions, here rendered one-of-a-kind. And each in its ingenious, intricate morphology hints a model of attachment on distinctive terms.</span></p>

	Quotidian inscriptions &ndash; annotating, jotting notes, making lists &ndash; are some of those &ldquo;things we do everyday&rdquo; that, despite their everydayness, are constantly being <i>de</i>naturalized, reimagined, and redesigned for different writing substrates and media platforms (from clay tablets to quipu to Blackberries to the back of your hand) and different populations and settings and applications (from professional conferences to the grocery store).

	Examining the way individuals or groups of people take notes, historian Ann Blair suggests, can &ldquo;shed light on cultural expectations and material practices that are representative of a particular historical context&rdquo; and can reveal how &ldquo;methods of note taking&hellip;contribute to shaping the modes of thought and argument characteristic of that milieu.&rdquo;<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Blair acknowledges that a &ldquo;spate of recent work&rdquo; has begun to &ldquo;uncover the culturally specific practices of note taking in various European contexts ranging especially from antiquity to the eighteenth century.&rdquo; Through this research, we learn about ancient bookkeeping, Biblical lists, commonplacing, readers&rsquo; use of notes as a means of dialoguing with texts and authors, the outsourcing of annotation, collective note-taking practices, and changing conceptions of note taking as a means of either strengthening or externalizing memory.</span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font: 12px Garamond; min-height: 13px;"">
	But what about the <i>new</i> everyday? Despite the fact that the cultural context for note-taking, and the materials about which and with which we take notes, have changed dramatically since the eighteenth century, Blair says, &ldquo;there is little [work] so far that addresses how note taking is changing as new tools have become and continue to become available, from the Post-it to the highlighter to software programs and the Palm Pilot.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font: 12px Garamond;"">
	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">&nbsp;Education scholars often examine the pedagogy of note-taking, and some social scientists, especially those whose work focuses on aging and memory, have studied list-making. But few of these formal studies address the new materiality of notes and lists. It seems fitting that those heeding Blair&rsquo;s call to action are debating the new digital tools of note-taking <i>through </i>some of those very tools. A group of tech-savvy academic bloggers &ndash; the <a href=""http://chronicle.com/section/About-ProfHacker/439/""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><i>ProfHacker</i></span></a><i> </i>collective &ndash; has sparked lively discussions about <a href=""http://chronicle.com/blogPost/How-Do-You-Organize-and/23839/""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">annotation software</span></a>; personal note-managing databases like <a href=""http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Take-a-Minute-to-Collect-Yo/24020/""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Evernote</span></a>; note-taking, outlining, and writing programs like <a href=""http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Scrivener-Scrivening-Scri/23026/""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Scrivener</span></a>; and to-do list managers like <a href=""http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Putting-the-THINGS-in-GTD-/22908/""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Things</span></a>.

	In this cluster of <i>The New Everyday</i> we examine new everyday inscriptions, both the scholarly and the utterly mundane &ndash; from the grocery list to the collaboratively organized and annotated archive. The nine essays in this cluster focus on notes both physical and virtual, found and made, formal and informal, collaboratively and individually created, means-to-ends and ends-in-themselves. We begin with <b>Heidi Wilkins&rsquo;</b> description of SP-ARK, filmmaker Sally Potter&rsquo;s online documentation of her filmmaking process, and the participatory processes through which users navigate and annotate &ldquo;pathways&rdquo; through the collection, thereby animating the archive. Users, Wilkins suggests, &ldquo;increase the significance of the already valuable items featured on SP-ARK by adding their personal notes and ideas.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

	The scholarly <i>value</i> of notes and other everyday inscriptions is a question at the center of <b>Dan Cohen&rsquo;s</b> essay. Cohen examines the &ldquo;calculus of importance&rdquo; behind the Library of Congress&rsquo;s decision to archive all public Tweets created since 2006. He argues that the resources and effort expended to secure what some might regard as a &ldquo;mass of worthless and mundane musings&rdquo; is well worth it, considering the cost of archiving tweets compared to the expense of storing physical media &ndash; and bearing in mind the potential historical value today&rsquo;s digital ephemera might have for future historians.&nbsp;</p>

	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">&nbsp;</span><b>Katie Harvey</b> then describes another collectively-constructed collection that, although perhaps not (yet) of interest to the L.O.C., is of tremendous importance to the fan community that created it and to those whose life&rsquo;s work it documents. Harvey discusses the analog-to-digital evolution of Grateful Dead &ldquo;shared tape&rdquo; lists, which generated their own notational language and elaborate listing protocols and which, over time, have come to codify not only the history of the Dead, but also &ldquo;the history and future of [its fan] community.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font: 12px Garamond; min-height: 13px;"">
	While the language and protocols of Harvey&rsquo;s lists are meant to make tape sharing accessible and intelligible to a wide community, other types of list-making and note-taking needn&rsquo;t make sense to anyone but the list-maker. As <b>John Thompson</b> explains in his examination of the grocery list, the seeming informality and triviality of these lists often belies a complex, culturally-informed selection, sorting, and inscription process. The grocery list can serve as a place where we negotiate between the competing rhetorics and ideologies of global agribusiness and genetic engineering, on the one hand, and &ldquo;slow food&rdquo; and localism, on the other. The mundane grocery list &ldquo;might take on a function of constitutive rhetoric,&rdquo; helping us define who we are as consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font: 12px Garamond; min-height: 13px;"">
	Do such personalized lists represent anything to anyone other than those who create them? <b>Laura Bergeron and Linda Levitt</b> consider how the found notes and lists posted to <a href=""http://www.foundmagazine.com/""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><i>Found Magazine</i></span></a><i> </i>can foster relationships between visitors, cryptic inscriptions, and their anonymous writers. In the comments section of the site, visitors often construct narratives about the imagined authors of these textual artifacts, and, in the process, occasionally learn something about themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font: 12px Garamond; min-height: 13px;"">
	While <i>Found&rsquo;</i>s commenters often use found lists to engage in amateur psychoanalysis of their imagined authors, scholars and curators can find tremendous research value in everyday lists uncovered in the archive. <b>Liza Kirwin</b> proposes that the myriad lists in the Smithsonian&rsquo;s Archives of American Art &ndash; from artists&rsquo; to-do lists to visual and verbal lists of artworks &ndash; can &ldquo;give insight into the list-maker&rsquo;s personal habits and enrich our understanding of individual biographies,&rdquo; or &ldquo;reveal the process by which [creative or mundane] decisions are made.&rdquo; Ad Reinhardt&rsquo;s graphic thumbnail listing of his black paintings, for instance, &ldquo;reveals their underlying geometry&rdquo; &ndash; an infrastructure hard to discern from their seemingly uniform surfaces. Some lists, like Alfred Konrad&rsquo;s picture list of the contents of his suitcase on a 1963 trip to Cairo, &ldquo;can be works of art in and of themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

She argues that a small but significant apparatus of note-sorting, the paperclip, because of its tendency to puncture documents or stain them with rust, has been &ldquo;banished from the historical record,&rdquo; thereby obscuring one of the &ldquo;micro-logics by which bureaucratic labor collects and connects.&rdquo; The new everyday of email attachments and paperclip icons, she explains, alters the identities of and relationships between documents and their attachments. Looking back to various forms of the analogue paperclip, &ldquo;each in its ingenious intricate morphology,&rdquo; Gitelman suggests, can help us to consider a &ldquo;model of attachment on distinctive terms.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font: 12px Garamond; min-height: 13px;"">
	Morphologies are also central to <b>Andrew Piper</b>&rsquo;s exploration of the relationships between notes and books &ndash; a relationship that is changing as &ldquo;our notes and our books increasingly belong the same medium.&rdquo;&nbsp; He explores myriad writers&rsquo; conceptions of the note and their understanding of its role in visualizing the writing process, in making and undoing ideas, in advancing the &ldquo;metamorphosis surrounding composition,&rdquo; in materializing the relationship between writing and thought. Piper proposes that &ldquo;in a world of digital notes the printed book will continue to argue for the morphological nature of writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font: 12px Garamond; min-height: 13px;"">
	<b>Kate Eichhorn</b>, who offers the final piece in this cluster, finds that her messy, overstuffed analogue day-timer makes just such an argument. As &ldquo;its guts lay bare a body torn apart by the need to live in many worlds,&rdquo; Eichhorn&rsquo;s planner reflects the poetics of her everyday life, its &ldquo;specific rhythm, visuality and structure of feeling.&rdquo; Despite feeling the pressure to join the digerati and adopt a Blackberry, Eichhorn considers the morphologies and materialities of both analogue and digital planners. In order for the Blackberry to win her over, it has to prove its value not simply as a &ldquo;tool for information management&rdquo; or a mnemonic device, but as a &ldquo;palimpsest of everyday practice and innovation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

	In the age of the BlackBerry, my August-to-August black vinyl covered pocket-sized book is already a relic. Like the sight of a clunky Sony Walkman at the gym, its function is still recognizable, but it&rsquo;s more likely to be read as an artifact than as a tool of information management. In classrooms and meetings, my day-timer and ritualized relationship to this book is even a topic of discussion. Colleagues and students remark upon my refined but seemingly inefficient system of information management. Why would someone with my schedule and range of administrative duties resist the temptation to adopt a more efficient technology? Why not splurge on a BlackBerry or iPhone? Of course, my day-timer is only a system of information management on the surface. Far more than a list of tasks, it&rsquo;s a deeply personalized altered book. Read closely, it tells the story of a life. Its guts lay bare a body torn apart by the need to live in many worlds -- or more accurately, many institutional contexts -- and because there is no delete function, there is no way to obscure the messiness of this life. On the inside front cover, a litany of numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		8 MTWF 3 10 11:40 MTWTF 6 W. Break F 8 or 12 (M and W) Winter (T and Th. M ( MTWTF 3 3000 4000 / Enr. # 2010000014367155 /gn.2019 Northside 7000 Berry and N. 1st 4000 USER ID + Part 1 (5000 + 24000) Part 2 (15000) rend deduc. $500 . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Times, dates, street addresses, pins, passwords, financial figures&mdash;as much as the names by which we are interpellated, these sums, codes and coordinates call us into being in a world where being itself is deeply entangled in a cycle of being accounted for and accountable to the institutions we invariably navigate in our everyday life. These numbers are part of what sociologist Dorothy Smith describes as the &ldquo;textual realities&rdquo; that both define who we are and place our actual experiences of everyday life under erasure: &ldquo;Textual realities are not fictions or falsehoods; they are normal, integral, and indeed essential features of the relations and apparatuses of ruling.&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;1&quot;]Dorothy Smith, The Conceptual Practices of Power: A Feminist Sociology of Knowledge (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1990), 83.[/fn]</p>
<p>
	Beyond the cover of my day-timer, the reader discovers other layers of the factual surfaces that structure my textual reality: places to be, people to meet, things to do. But here too is evidence of how I manage to &ldquo;make do&rdquo; within the institutional contexts I navigate on a daily basis. Completed tasks are marked by an exaggerated checkmark. Incomplete tasks are crossed out but usually rewritten, or simply circled and transferred with an arrow to another block of time or day. During especially chaotic periods, a day or entire week may be covered up with a new scrap of paper or series of sticky notes (sometimes one has no other option but to begin again). Finally, in the tradition of altered books, my day-timer is also an archive of other documents. On the occasion of writing this essay, I discover a dental insurance card, a sticker featuring the code to a long lost combination lock, an advertisement for a multifunction printer, three business cards, two invoices and a printed Google Map from here to somewhere else.</p>
<p>
	As evidenced by my day-timer, my life is one deeply mediated by texts and the textual realities of institutions, but day-timers and their lists may also tell other stories, including those that may on the surface appear to have little or no connection to texts at all. I grew up in a house with few books and with a father who appeared to rarely if ever write. Nevertheless, there were tiny notebooks stashed around the house. Small enough to fit in the pocket of a grubby pair of GWGs and not fall out into the field, these notebooks contained few if any words&mdash;they simply contained lists of numbers. Only years later while researching the history of ledger books would I come to appreciate that these cryptic lists of numbers were an archive of temperatures and yields and prices&mdash;an invaluable record of what was grown, with what results and at what cost. Writing this essay, a reflection on my own cursive hand in a &ldquo;BlackBerry field,&rdquo; I again recall these miniature notebooks with their cryptic numeric lists, but now understand them not simply as archives of work but also as lists inextricably linked to the fields in which they were written and meant to document, reminding me that lists can and do document all kinds of labor, including labor that appears to be carried out beyond the institutions and textual realities that govern my own life. Writing this essay has also given me occasion to reflect on the surprising ways in which these mysterious notebooks with their numeric lists overlap with my own day-timer. Neither the cryptic notebooks I recall from my childhood nor my day-timer constitutes a form of writing or an artifact with any obvious aesthetic qualities, but they are both deeply reflective of the poetics of everyday life. Lists, whether composed in institutions or fields, are marked by a specific rhythm, visuality and structure of feeling, and in either case, they reveal much about the writer&rsquo;s operativity in the world.</p>

	The concept of everyday life is ubiquitous, but its referents are as varied as life itself. The everyday has been used to theorize everything from the history of home appliances to television. While such objects or phenomena may be part of the everyday, I maintain that the everyday, as a conceptual category and something we actually experience, may be far less concrete despite its rootedness in material culture. To begin, &ldquo;The everyday is that which is most familiar,&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;2&quot;]Highmore, Everyday Life and Cultural Theory, 2.[/fn] &ldquo;what lags and falls back, the residual life with which our trash cans and cemeteries are filled: scrap and refuse.&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;3&quot;]Maurice Blanchot quoted by Michael E. Gardiner, Critique of Everyday Life (New York: Routledge, 2000), 1.[/fn] It is &ldquo;talking, reading, moving about, shopping, cooking.&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;4&quot;]Michel de Certeau, The Practice of Everyday Life, Vol. 1, trans. Steven Randall (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988), xix.[/fn] It is &ldquo;profoundly related to all activities, and encompasses them with all their differences and their conflicts; it is their meeting place, their bond, their common ground.&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;5&quot;]Henri Lefebvre, Critique of Everyday Life, Vol. I, trans. J. Moore (London: Verso, 1991), 97. [/fn] Everyday life is &ldquo;objectification in its entirety.&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;6&quot;]Agnes Heller, Everyday Life (London: Routledge, 1984), 48. [/fn] It is &ldquo;an actual material setting, an actual local and particular place in the world.&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;7&quot;]Dorothy E. Smith, The Everyday World as Problematic: A Feminist Sociology (Boston: Northeastern University Press, 1987), 97.[/fn] Everyday life is &ldquo;the commute, the errand, the appointment&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;8&quot;]Alice Kaplan and Kristin Ross, &ldquo;Introduction to Everyday Life&rdquo; in The Everyday Life Reader, ed.

Timothy J. Tomasik (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1988), 3.[/fn] &ldquo;Polyrythmia from the first listening,&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;10&quot;]Henri Lefebvre, Rhythmanalysis: Space, Time and Everyday Life (New York: Continuum, 2001), 16.

Ben Highmore, 238. [/fn] Read through these discursive traces culled from only a few of the theorists by whom my own understanding of the everyday is informed, the everyday evokes affects and desires, struggles and constraints and a certain degree of tension&mdash;productive tension. The everyday is not simply what is, then, but also what is forced to the surface, spills-over, bubbles up, makes itself known. The everyday is the banal that paradoxically insists upon being heard and seen, and the list is one of the places where this visible and audible banal is most apparent.</p>
<p>
	On this basis, I maintain that lists are not simply reflections of what we intend to do, carry out or fail to accomplish, but forms that map the flows, fits and starts, violent interruptions and gaps that mark our everyday lives. Form, as Charles Bernstein argues, may be simply understood as &ldquo;ways of putting things together, or stripping them apart . . . how any one of us interprets what&rsquo;s swirling so often incomprehensibly about us.&rdquo; If we further adopt Bernstein&rsquo;s definition of poetry as an &ldquo;aversion to conformity in pursuit of new forms,&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;15&quot;]Charles Bernstein, A Poetics (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992), 1. [/fn] without necessarily conflating the list with the list poem, it is possible to appreciate lists as a minor but ubiquitous form that offers itself up as a primary site of textual intervention&mdash;the most basic, most immediate, most familiar form available for manipulation, repetition, aversion and invention in the relentless flow of the everyday.</p>
<p>
	Michel de Certeau and Luce Girard maintain that culture &ldquo;is not information, but its treatment by a series of operations as a function of objectives and social relations.&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;16&quot;] Michel de Certeau and Luce Girard, The Practice of Everyday Life, Vol. 2, 254.[/fn] Recognizing that &ldquo;[t]he first aspect of these operations is aesthetic,&rdquo; they further emphasize that &ldquo;an everyday practice opens up a unique space within an imposed order, as does the poetic gesture that bends the use of common language to its own desire in a transforming reuse.&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;17&quot;]Ibid.[/fn] If &ldquo;everyday practice patiently and tenaciously restores a space for play, an interval of freedom, a resistance to what is imposed from a model, a system, or an order),&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;18&quot;] Ibid., 255.[/fn] a poetics of everyday life is no more or no less a theory of how we make do, how we carve out small spaces of pleasure within the constraints of our daily grinds. Perhaps, if I hesitate to abandon my inefficient day-timer for a more efficient electronic prosthetic, it&rsquo;s because I have yet to understand how these new devices will adequately serve me not simply as tools of information management but as forms ripe for aversion, play and pleasure&mdash;not mere mnemonic devices but palimpsests of everyday practice and innovation. What better companion and accomplice for one&rsquo;s labor, after all, than a messy, corporeally embedded scene of operativity?</p>

They set an agenda. They clarify and catalog.</p>
<p>
	The Smithsonian&rsquo;s Archives of American Art counts hundreds of thousands of lists among its collections&mdash;to-do lists, membership lists, lists of paintings sold, lists of appointments made and met, lists of supplies to get, and lists of people who are &ldquo;in.&rdquo; This led me to wonder, what can these seemingly incidental records tell us about the list maker and&nbsp; the moment of list making.&nbsp; To answer the question, I made a list of five types of lists from the Archives of American Art to consider:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		biographical lists</li>
	<li>
		name lists</li>
	<li>
		to-dos</li>
	<li>
		inventories</li>
	<li>
		word lists</li>
</ol>
<h4>
	1. Biographical lists</h4>
<p>
	A good biographical list provides a compact personal narrative from the point of view of he compiler. &nbsp;In 1927, journalist H. L. Mencken (1800&ndash;1956) wrote a letter about his personality traits entirely in the form of a list from 1 to 29.</p>
<p class=""img-center"">
	<img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/mencken.preview.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Number 4 reads: &ldquo;Curiously enough, I greatly dislike the common American dirty stories, and avoid the men who tell them habitually. They seem dull to me. I love the obscene, but it must have wit in it&rdquo;; and no. 10: &ldquo;If I ever marry, it will be on a sudden impulse, as a man shoots himself.&rdquo; He sent this list-letter to artist and writer Charles Green Shaw (1892&ndash;1974) for his book <i>The Low Down</i>, a collection of celebrity portraits.&nbsp; Mencken was an acerbic critic of American life and long-time writer for the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>, and his lively list lays bare his opinionated prose style, but it also provides an intimate view of his follies and foibles. Shaw published it nearly verbatim. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
	<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""line-height: 17px;""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""line-height: 20px;""><img align=""left"" border=""0"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/evergood.preview.jpg"" style=""margin-right: 10px; width: 221px; height: 357px;"" /></span>Every r&eacute;sum&eacute; is an autobiography in list form and almost every collection of artists&rsquo; papers contains multiple r&eacute;sum&eacute;s.&nbsp; At a glance, they show the development of a career through accrued accomplishments&mdash;education, teaching engagements, solo and group exhibitions, etc.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
	<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""line-height: 17px;"">Before the age of computers and easily updated electronic lists, artists such as Philip Evergood (1900&ndash;1973)&nbsp; kept current by manually adding information to his typed &ldquo;master&rdquo; r&eacute;sum&eacute;.&nbsp; When it was barely readable, a new &ldquo;master&rdquo; was typed.&nbsp; He saved the earlier versions.&nbsp; The density of the emendations was proof of his ability to survive and thrive as an artist.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""img-center"">
	<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""line-height: 17px;"">While individuals often pad their r&eacute;sum&eacute;, stretching their skills and experience, painter and theorist Ad Reinhart (1913&ndash;1967) elevated the expanded r&eacute;sum&eacute; to a fine art.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the mid-1960s he set down in his elegant and distinctive calligraphy a detailed list of his life&rsquo;s events.&nbsp; Beginning with his birth in 1913, he inserts major art historical happenings, such as the 1913 Armory Show, the first international exhibition of modern art in the United States, into his life story.&nbsp; The list, on 8 x 11&rdquo;, onion-skin pages, cut and taped together, is four feet high.&nbsp; In this tall tale, Reinhardt&rsquo;s life story and the history of art become one in the same.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""image-center"">
	<img border=""0"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/reinhardt_resume_1_0.preview.jpg"" style=""margin-right: 10px; width: 180px; height: 245px;"" /> <img border=""0"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/reinhardt_resume_2_0.preview.jpg"" style=""margin-right: 10px; width: 180px; height: 244px;"" /> <img border=""0"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/reinhardt_resume_3.preview.jpg"" style=""margin-right: 10px; width: 180px; height: 244px;"" /></p>
<h4>
	2. Name lists</h4>
<p>
	<img align=""right"" border=""0"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/catlin.preview.jpg"" style=""margin-left: 10px; width: 280px; height: 338px;"" /><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">There are perhaps more name lists in the Archives than any other kind of list.&nbsp; These include membership lists, mailing lists, lists of models, lists of invited guests, and the like.&nbsp; In 1830s, painter George Catlin (1796&ndash;1872), who recorded American Indian culture through portraits and scenes from daily life, kept a list of English translations of Indian names from the various tribes; for instance <i>Ah&#39;-sho-cole</i>, from his list, means &ldquo;Rotten Foot&rdquo; in Pawnee. Catlin painted <i>Ah&#39;-sho-cole, </i>a noted Pawnee warrior, in 1834.&nbsp; The list represents Catlin&rsquo;s efforts to accurately represent his subjects.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
	Painter Ludwig Sander (1906&ndash;1975) kept an early, if not the first membership list of The Club, a postwar group of New York artists legendary for its polemic discussions. <img align=""left"" border=""0"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/sander.preview.jpg"" style=""margin-right: 10px; width: 212px; height: 263px;"" />The list reminds us that someone had to keep track of who was who, and where they were, for scheduling meetings.&nbsp; Sander doodled in the margins, perhaps passing time while phoning members.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;The Archives&rsquo; most notable name list is Pablo Picasso&rsquo;s (1881&ndash;1973) recommendations for the 1913 Armory Show. <img align=""right"" border=""0"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/picasso.preview.jpg"" style=""margin-left: 10px;"" />Walt Kuhn, who played a major role in assembling the show, had limited knowledge of the European avant-garde. He relied on American artists then living abroad, as well as Europeans in the know, such as Picasso, for introductions to contemporary European artists and dealers. With phonetic spelling, Picasso names Marcel Duchamp, whose Nude Descending a Staircase (1912) would cause an uproar in the American press, Fernand L&eacute;ger, and the Spaniard Juan Gris, among others. Curiously, he did not include his collaborator and fellow cubist Georges Braque, whose name was later added in Kuhn&rsquo;s hand. In the end, the Europeans stole the show, overshadowing their American counterparts. The list reveals something of the process of organizing this transcontinental exhibition. Opinions were sought, lists were made, and selections were finalized to represent the best modern art at that moment.</p>
<p>
	One of the most visually impressive name lists is Ray Johnson&rsquo;s (1927&ndash;1995) photocopied list of people who posed for his &ldquo;silhouette portraits&rdquo;. <img align=""left"" border=""0"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/johnson.preview.jpg"" style=""margin-right: 10px; width: 360px; height: 577px;"" /><br />
	Johnson is best known for his enigmatic collages and as the founder of the New York Correspondance [intentional misspelling] School, an international network of poets and artists who exchanged artwork through the postal system. Between 1976 and 1982, he made silhouette portraits and kept a list of the people who &ldquo;kindly posed.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is unclear if he actually made silhouettes of everyone listed, or if the list sent through the mail was the art event.&nbsp; The names are a who&rsquo;s who of the famous and not-so-famous&mdash;an art-world jumble with Johnson as the only common denominator.&nbsp; Johnson sent this list to another &ldquo;Johnson,&rdquo; art historian Ellen Johnson, as a thank you for participating in his project. (In a subsequent list of silhouette portraits dated 1979, Ellen Johnson&rsquo;s name appears at number 207.)</p>
<h4 style=""clear: both;"">
	3. To-dos</h4>
<p>
	<img align=""left"" border=""0"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/weinman.preview.jpg"" style=""margin-right: 10px; width: 253px; height: 316px;"" />To-dos are often the most substantive lists.&nbsp; They tell us what we have done or what we hope to do.&nbsp; They help us organize our time.&nbsp; They focus our attention forward, instilling confidence in our ability to complete tasks and move on.&nbsp; When Adolph A. Weinman (1870&ndash;1952) established his own sculpture studio in New York in 1904, he practiced the Beaux-Arts style of his teachers&mdash;Olin Levi Warner, Charles Henry Niehaus and others&mdash;characterized by classical forms, symmetry, rich ornamentation, and grand scale. Weinman&rsquo;s works conveyed weighty themes&mdash;duty, purity, love, liberty, repentance&mdash;through lightly veiled allegories. He made a to-do list of possible compositions such as, &ldquo;make David either in the act of throwing stone or picking up stone,&rdquo; and &ldquo;make St. George on horseback pushing sword into scabbard.&rdquo;&nbsp; For Weinman, the moment of greatest emotional impact was the just before felling Goliath or just after slaying the dragon.&nbsp; While he was a prolific architectural sculptor for such firms as McKim, Mead, and White, there is no evidence that he completed these projects.</p>
<p>
	On August 16, 1961, architect Eero Saarinen (1910&ndash;1961) made a to-do list of 53 tasks&mdash;from the exceptional, &ldquo;discuss master plan of Chicago,&rdquo; to the everyday, &ldquo;fix light in living room&rdquo;.&nbsp; Saarinen, who designed such structural icons as the TWA terminal (1962) at JFK International Airport in New York and the Gateway Arch in St. Louis (1965), was a great list maker and a consummate multitasker. While most of his lists are to-dos, he was also fond of enumerating his second wife&rsquo;s good qualities&mdash; &ldquo;generous, attractive, amusing, intelligent, talented, love-able, constructive, creative&rdquo; in red pencil, with hearts, or noting in Roman numerals best-to-worst-case scenarios (including the time-line for his divorce from is first wife).&nbsp; Five days after he wrote his August 16th to-do, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor.&nbsp; Ten days later he was dead from complications of surgery.&nbsp; Saarinen was 51 and busy with major architectural projects, as well as his home renovations. The list remains as evidence of tasks left forever undone.</p>

<p>
	Janice Lowry&rsquo;s (1946&ndash;2009) to-do lists are among the most engaging in the Archives. An introspective assemblage artist, she kept a journal for nearly forty years that filled 126 bound volumes, many elaborately illustrated and all peppered with to-dos&mdash;&ldquo;make plane res/car/hotel,&rdquo; &ldquo;mail announcements,&rdquo; &ldquo;get rain gutters&rdquo;.</p>
<p class=""img-center"">
	<img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/lowry_1.preview.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	The recurrent tasks, such as &ldquo;pay bills,&rdquo; are interspersed with her dream recollections and random thoughts, each page thick with collaged images, paint, stamps and stickers&mdash;a vivid backdrop for her daily chores.&nbsp; The lists propel her forward from one day to the next.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Lowry also used lists as a kind of self-help therapy to articulate problems and sort out her feelings. Such to-do lists as &ldquo;people I need to forgive,&rdquo; which had some overlap with her list of &ldquo;fifty angry grievances,&rdquo; helped her examine personal issues and work toward a resolution.</p>
<h4>
	4. Inventories</h4>
<p>
	Art dealers, registrars, and executors of artists&rsquo; estates are in a constant state of tracking works of art&mdash;lists of works for sale, lists of works in the studio, lists of works in storage.&nbsp; In the late 1940s, art dealer Germain Seligmann (1893&ndash;1978) made numerous lists of family treasures and gallery stock in Paris that had been seized and sold by order of the pro-Nazi Vichy government during World War II. His lists of tapestries, silver, porcelains, and drawings were part of his legal claim to retrieve stolen property.</p>
<p>
	While most inventories are fairly routine, in the hands of artists, an illustrated inventory can document the art-making process and even become a work of art in and of itself.&nbsp; Perhaps only an artist would make a graphic list like Adolf Konrad&rsquo;s (1915&ndash;2003), showing, in picture form, the contents of his suitcase on a trip to Cairo in December 1963.</p>
<p class=""img-center"">
	<img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/konrad.preview.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	In 1932, painter and color theorist Oscar Bluemner (1867&ndash;1938) made an illustrated list of his recently completed landscape paintings, including thumbnail sketches with information about the dimensions, date, media, and in some cases the subject of each work of art.</p>
<p class=""img-center"">
	<img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/bluemner_0.preview.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	His list is a graphic catalogue, a snapshot of his current production, though one wonders about Bluemners&rsquo; state of mind.&nbsp; The crowded page, as well as his habit of appending one list to another with shorthand marks and abbreviations, tends to obfuscate rather than clarify his inventory.</p>
<p>
	Ad Reinhardt (whose r&eacute;sum&eacute; is above) was known for his radical, achromatic black paintings. From the mid-1950s until his death, he painted almost exclusively with black. He made a graphic list of black paintings for a major retrospective of his work at The Jewish Museum in New York City in 1966.</p>
<p class=""img-center"">
	<img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/reinhardt.preview.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	<p""> In his thumbnail sketches, Reinhardt reveals their underlying geometry, the direction of the brush strokes that give minimal form to the black surface.</p""></p>
<h4>
	5. Word lists</h4>
<p>
	Word lists, or a vocabulary piled up through free association, reveal the list maker&rsquo;s thought process.&nbsp; Painter and feminist Joan Snyder (b. 1940) made a list of words defining &ldquo;female sensibility.&rdquo; Her list, written in hot pink felt-tip pen, provides a layering of meaning and richness to a larger concept.</p>
<p class=""img-center"">
	<img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/snyder.preview.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	In 1951, Ad Reinhardt made a list of ―undesirable words‖ and ―more adequate words‖ for ―art,‖ as well as a list of ―dualisms.‖ He was deeply interested in Eastern philosophy, favoring words for art that were intellectually and emotionally expansive, for example, ―consciousness,‖ freedom,‖ and ―imagination.‖.</p>
<p class=""img-center"">
	<img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/reinhardt_scrivener_1.preview.jpg"" /><img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/reinhardt_scrivener_2.preview.jpg"" /><img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/reinhardt_scrivener_3.preview.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	Unlike the binary oppositions fundamental to Western thought, Reinhardt understood duality as a philosophy of balance, where two opposites coexist in harmony and are able to transmute into each other&mdash;the yin and yang of all things.</p>
<p>
	Sculptor Robert Morris (b. 1931) avoided making formal statements about his work; instead, he raised provocative questions about the essence of art.&nbsp; In a 1967 postcard to curator Samuel J. Wagstaff, Morris listed alternative language for the new term &ldquo;earthworks,&rdquo; a form of art created in nature that uses natural materials such as soil and stones.</p>
<p>
	With his invented word and phrases&mdash;&ldquo;Dirt art. Dirty art. Bogs, Geometic quagmires.&nbsp; Square swamps&rdquo;&mdash;Morris neither criticizes nor endorses the movement, but plays with the nebulous border separating the untouched earth&mdash;&ldquo;at her fatuous flat chested best&rdquo;&mdash;from one that is manipulated by the artist.&nbsp; Both Morris&rsquo;s and Reinhardt&rsquo;s lists underscore the limits of language to define something as elusive as art.</p>
<h4>
	Conclusions</h4>
<p>
	Lists, whether dashed off as a quick reminder or carefully constructed as a comprehensive inventory, give insight into the list maker&rsquo;s personal habits and enrich our understanding of individual biographies. They reveal the process by which decisions are made, or show the winnowing down of an argument to its essential points.&nbsp; In the hands of artists, lists can even be works of art in and of themselves.</p>

	The documentary centers on an underground beauty clinic in Puerto Rico, where men and women receive silicone, botox and other treatments, as well as share advice, ideas and support each other. Central to the film are a group of transgender sex workers, many of whom hope to use their work to fund their transitioning&nbsp;surgery.</p>

	A month later, as the discussions with Media Commons were underway to launch this e-journal, we heard the news of the brutal murder of Jorge Steven L&oacute;pez Mercado, a nineteen year-old who was part of the crowd at the clinic but did not feature in the original film. It at once seemed right that this terrible event should be the subject of our first&nbsp;cluster.</p>

	Carmen Oquendo-Villar quickly cut a short excerpt from her footage, which will not appear in the finished film, to rebut the statements being made by or on behalf of the confessed killer Juan Mart&iacute;nez Matos (26). It was claimed that he was unaware that the location where he picked up Jorge Steven was frequented by transgender sex workers and that he was traumatized when he encountered Jorge Steven&rsquo;s body. Oquendo-Villar&rsquo;s short film makes it clear that such &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; were extremely unlikely and describes the violence that the sex workers encounter&nbsp;everyday.</p>

	Cuando se cayeron las flores y los frutos y los &aacute;rboles quedaron desnudos, sintieron pudor y fueron a esconderse.</p>
<p>
	Entonces dios que quer&iacute;a castigarlos, los castig&oacute;.</p>
<p>
	Y los &aacute;rboles cayeron entonces. De golpe. Tantos &aacute;rboles pesados cayeron al mismo tiempo que produjeron un ruido estruendoso. Entonces la gente se di&oacute; cuenta que los dioses estaban enojados. Porque temblaba la tierra de furia divina.</p>
<p>
	Tan fuerte fue el impacto de los &aacute;rboles cayendo que se sacudieron los mares y produjeron unas olas enormes que se tragaron a la tierra.</p>
<p>
	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5QPDDweieQ</p>
<p>
	Y toda esa furia tenia una raz&oacute;n de ser. Los dioses estaban enojadas por los homosexuales que viv&iacute;an en la tierra. Y no iban a parar de tirar &aacute;rboles con el viento, &aacute;rboles muertos y desnudos hasta que se acabaran los gays sobre la tierra. Y fu&eacute; as&iacute; como un grupo de gente muy piadosa, devota a la gloria de dios y del servicio al pr&oacute;jimo quizo ayudar a los dioses y decidieron empezar a matar homosexuales para que los dioses ya no esten enojados.</p>
<p>
	Y asi fue como un grupo de gente muy piadosa quizo ayudar a los dioses y decidieron empezar a matar a los gays, para que los dioses ya no esten enojados.</p>
<p>
	Por cada homosexual que mataban los dioses se pon&iacute;an un poquito m&aacute;s contentos. Cuando ya se habian terminado los gays y los enterraron a todos en el centro de la tierra, entonces los dioses se pusieron contentos y se calmaron los mares y los vientos. Y volvieron a crecer &aacute;rboles con hojas y flores. Las ni&ntilde;as correteaban en los jardines, con sus vestiditos rosas con mo&ntilde;itos y los ni&ntilde;os jugaban con los camioncitos y los rev&oacute;lveres. Hab&iacute;a paz y armon&iacute;a, porque esa era la voluntad del Se&ntilde;or. Y por cada ni&ntilde;o con una pijita habia una ni&ntilde;a con un agujerito. Todo estaba cuidadosamente calculado. Porque un dia se iban a casar y tener mas hijitos, porque en el reino del se&ntilde;or habia que consumar matrimonio. Asi que dios ya no se volvio a enojar. No habia ninguna raz&oacute;n para enojarse. Dios se enoja cuando ve gays. Pero ya no quedaba ninguno. Dios tambien se enoja si la gente no reza. Pero toda la gente rezaba. Dios tambien se enoja si la gente se acuesta con el vecino o comete adulterio. Pero nadie se acostaba con el vecino ni cometia adulterio. Dios tambien se enoja si la gente cocina el cordero dado vuelta sin sal o si le ponen levadura al pan. Pero nadie le ponia levadura al pan y todos dieron vuelta al cordero salado.</p>
<p>
	Y que habia que ayudar a los pobre decia dios. Asi que le cambiaron el nombre a los pobres. Asi que ya no habia pobres en el sentido biblico.</p>
<p>
	Y si habia no mportaba, porque los pobres sabian que habia un mundo mejor esperando por ellos. pero tenian que morirse primero.</p>
<p>
	Y los pobres se quedaron muy contentos entonces porque ellos iban a ser bienvenidos en el reino del Se&ntilde;or.</p>
<p>
	Pero los ricos, que habian inventado la mentira se pusieron celosos. Ellos tambi&eacute;n querian ser bienvenidos en el reino del Se&ntilde;or. Entonces empezaron a rezar y dijeron:</p>
<p>
	No es verdad que los ricos no van a entrar al cielo! El cielo esta lleno de millonarios! El cielo esta lleno de Americanos because God Loves America!</p>
<p>
	Va de Retro Satanas! Dijeron los demonios y escupieron unos fluidos asquerosos</p>
<p>
	Y las gentes de la tierra seguian leyendo y aprendiendo sobre sus origenes</p>
<p>
	Adan fue hecho del polvo y Eva era una costilla!</p>
<p>
	No! Gritaban las mujeres, Eva no era una costilla, Eva fue creada con una costilla!</p>
<p>
	Y los hombres dijeron: Adan estaba solo y Dios creo a Eva para el y deliberadamente despues de el.. Y por eso comemos las costillas del puerco y de las vacas porque nos recuerda a la esposa de Adan y a la santidad del matrimonio.</p>
<p>
	Y advirtieron a los cristianos del desorden y el caos que se armaria si la gente no se casara.</p>
<p>
	El mundo empezaria a pudrirse con fornicaci&oacute;n, promiscuidad e inmundicia.</p>
<p>
	Y las mujeres entonces se tiraban el agua hirviente de las cacerolas en sus ropas para lavar sus pecados.</p>
<p>
	Y los mal pensados infieles empezaron a insinuar lo que no deber&iacute;a insinuarse:</p>
<p>
	Porque ya tenia 33 a&ntilde;os y no se habia casado?.... NO! Gritaban los fieles,</p>
<p>
	Jesus no era gay! Todavia no se habia casado porque estaba muy ocupado curando a los enfermos y a los pobres!</p>
<p>
	Y que tanto rollo con los pobres? era zurdo?</p>
<p>
	No, Jesus no era comunista!</p>
<p>
	Estaba un poco confundido con el tema de los pobres pero no apoyo activamente ninguna revolucion!</p>
<p>
	Era el hijo de Dios y Maria, madre de dios ruega por nosotros pecadores ahora y en la hora de nuestra muerte</p>
<p>
	Y Dios baj&oacute; de los cielos y les dijo: No Matar&aacute;s!</p>
<p>
	Pero ellos mataron a los ciervos y colgaron las cabezas en sus casas</p>
<p>
	Y los guerreros se pusieron celosos y dijeron:</p>
<p>
	Porque pueden los cazadores colgar las cabezas de los ciervos? Nosotros tambi&eacute;n queremos colgar las cabezas de los que matamos!</p>
<p>
	Y entonces los guerreros colgaron en sus casas las cabezas de sus enemigos!</p>
<p>
	Y la sangre sguia corriendo por la tierra y se hicieron rios de sangre derramada</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Y mataban a los pollos, y mataban a los ni&ntilde;os y mataban a las vacas y mataban a las mujeres y mataban a los cerdos, y mataban a los soldados, y mataban a los toros, y mataban a los pescados</p>
<p>
	Y los ministros de dios dijeron es culpa de los hijos extramatrimoniales</p>
<p>
	y los sacerdotes dijeron es culpa de los homosexuales</p>
<p>
	Y los obispos dijeron es culpa de las mujeres liberadas e inmorales</p>
<p>
	Y las mujeres dijeron: Es culpa de la guerra</p>
<p>
	Y dios les dijo: No robaras, pero ellos seguian robando</p>
<p>
	Y bajo Armaggeddon y los angeles tocando arpas doradas y se murieron todos con las plagas porque les faltaba el aire, Y los cristianos se arrepintieron entonces de sus pecados y pidieron piedad al se&ntilde;or, pero era demasiado tarde, el agujero del cielo se estaba tragando a la tierra y se quemaron con el sol hasta incinerarse.</p>
<p>
	Los unicos que se salvaron eran los gays y lesbianas y transexuales y bisexuales que habian escondido abajo de la tierra.</p>
<p>
	y como a los gays les encanta reproducirse llenaron la tierra otra vez de hijos con inseminacion artificial</p>

	Cl&iacute;nica de Asistencia Legal sobre Discrimen por Orientaci&oacute;n Sexual e Identidad de G&eacute;nero (Universidad de Puerto Rico, Facultad de Derecho)</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Las palabras &ldquo;crimen&rdquo; y &ldquo;odio&rdquo; parecen ser axiomas de un mismo acto. Empero, cuando en el &aacute;mbito jur&iacute;dico local e internacional nos referimos a un crimen de odio, la discusi&oacute;n apunta al an&aacute;lisis de una conducta que est&aacute; motivada por tener un prejuicio hacia un individuo por pertenecer o percibir que pertenece a un grupo espec&iacute;fico.</p>
<p>
	Las legislaciones que pretenden disuadir a la poblaci&oacute;n de la comisi&oacute;n de estos delitos, generalmente protegen a los grupos raciales, religiosos, &eacute;tnicos, pol&iacute;ticos, discapacitados, de distinta orientaci&oacute;n sexual, g&eacute;nero, identidad de g&eacute;nero, edad, condici&oacute;n social, estado civil, entre otras.</p>
<p>
	En Puerto Rico la jurisprudencia no ha atendido nunca un delito motivado por el odio, o al menos no lo ha reconocido como tal. No obstante, en los &uacute;ltimos meses la presi&oacute;n colectiva local e internacional parece empujar para que el reciente asesinato del joven de 19 a&ntilde;os, Jorge Steven L&oacute;pez Mercado, sea juzgado como un crimen de odio.</p>
<p>
	Como mera coincidencia, el 28 de octubre del pasado a&ntilde;o, el Presidente de los Estados Unidos, Barack Obama, firm&oacute; la Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, la cual sirve para incluir, en la ley federal de cr&iacute;menes de odio de 1969, a las v&iacute;ctimas de cr&iacute;menes motivados por el g&eacute;nero real o percibido de la v&iacute;ctima, por orientaci&oacute;n sexual, identidad de g&eacute;nero o discapacidad.</p>
<p>
	Dicha ley establece una jurisdicci&oacute;n m&aacute;s amplia del gobierno federal para investigar los cr&iacute;menes de odio en aquellos estados en los que se perpetren, por lo que se podr&iacute;an radicar cargos bajo dicho estatuto en caso de que un gobierno estatal no tome acci&oacute;n sobre el particular. Puerto Rico est&aacute; amparado en esta disposici&oacute;n de ley por constituir un territorio de los Estados Unidos. Empero, los estatutos locales le otorgan a nuestro gobierno sus propios mecanismos para atender un crimen como &eacute;ste.</p>
<p>
	Dentro del nuevo C&oacute;digo Penal de Puerto Rico (2004), no hay recogida una modalidad de crimen de odio espec&iacute;fica. No obstante, el art&iacute;culo 72(q) del referido c&oacute;digo, establece lo que en derecho consideramos un agravante del delito.</p>
<p>
	Dicho art&iacute;culo de la ley establece que el agravante se constituye si &ldquo;el delito fue cometido o motivado por prejuicio hacia y contra la v&iacute;ctima por raz&oacute;n de raza, color, sexo, orientaci&oacute;n sexual, [&hellip;]. Para prop&oacute;sitos de establecer motivo como se dispone en este inciso, no ser&aacute; suficiente probar que el convicto posee una creencia particular, ni probar que el convicto meramente pertenece a alguna organizaci&oacute;n particular.&rdquo; N&oacute;tese, que esta disposici&oacute;n no busca coartar la libertad de expresi&oacute;n del ciudadano. Este agravante no surge cuando alguien hace una expresi&oacute;n racista u homof&oacute;bica, sino que se activa cuando se evidencia que un delito ya constituido en nuestra legislaci&oacute;n ha sido motivado por uno de estos factores.</p>
<p>
	Adem&aacute;s, es importante observar que para evidenciar que la comisi&oacute;n del delito se debi&oacute; al odio hacia un grupo particular la fiscal&iacute;a tendr&aacute; que presentar la prueba necesaria para probar que la motivaci&oacute;n para cometer el delito en especifico fue la animosidad o sentimiento en contra de dicho grupo o sector.</p>
<p>
	Por tanto, no podemos establecer que hay tal cosa como un crimen de odio, sino un delito que puede ser vulnerable a que su pena se vea aumentada si se prueba que su motivaci&oacute;n fue el odio hacia uno de los grupos protegidos. No obstante, si al confeso asesino de Jorge Steven L&oacute;pez, Juan Mart&iacute;nez Matos, lo encontraran culpable de asesinato en primer grado, dicha convicci&oacute;n no aparejar&iacute;a un aumento en la pena, por lo que la sentencia corresponder&iacute;a a 99 a&ntilde;os de prisi&oacute;n. Por tal raz&oacute;n, el efecto real de un procesamiento bajo este agravante ser&iacute;a simb&oacute;lico, ya que demostrar&iacute;a cu&aacute;l es la pol&iacute;tica p&uacute;blica del Estado, al menos seg&uacute;n expresada en la legislaci&oacute;n, de rechazo a este tipo de cr&iacute;menes y en pro de la lucha por la igualdad y el respeto a la diversidad del ser humano. Por otro lado, si este agravante surgiera a la vida dentro de un crimen con una pena que no llegara a ese l&iacute;mite m&aacute;ximo, tendr&iacute;a un efecto material en el aumento de la pena del individuo que lo cometi&oacute;.</p>
<p>
	Los cr&iacute;menes de odio son parte de la historia mundial. Basta con recordar la era del Holocausto cuando millones de jud&iacute;os fueron asesinatos por el Estado Nazi como consecuencia de su etnia. Evidentemente, las motivaciones de esta dictadura eran patentes en su discurso y descaradas en su abierta admisi&oacute;n. Sin embargo, cuando se trata de un crimen de odio en el que se envuelven s&oacute;lo dos individuos, corresponde al que quiere probar dicho agravante traer en evidencia la prueba necesaria para que se haga patente la existencia de una motivaci&oacute;n de este tipo.</p>
<p>
	Basado en lo que contempla nuestro ordenamiento, un agravante por &ldquo;crimen de odio&rdquo; tendr&iacute;a su mayor efecto en el &aacute;mbito de los procesos judiciales.</p>
<p>
	Una vez el tribunal ha encontrado culpable al acusado, el fiscal podr&aacute; solicitar que se escuche prueba para evidenciar agravantes a la pena que se impondr&aacute;. Dicha disposici&oacute;n, recogida por la regla 162.4 de las Reglas de Procedimiento Criminal, estipula tambi&eacute;n que se celebrar&aacute; una vista en caso de que haya una controversia real en cuanto a un hecho material que requiera que se presente prueba.</p>
<p>
	Es entonces, en el entendimiento y aceptaci&oacute;n del fiscal de que el delito cometido constituye un crimen de odio, donde radica la responsabilidad de que el agravante nazca a la vida, o se quede s&oacute;lo como una figura jur&iacute;dica que nunca adviene a la acci&oacute;n, mas se queda muerta en el texto de la ley.</p>
<p>
	Esta modalidad de atender el disloque en la conducta social que lleva a perpetrar estos cr&iacute;menes odio, puede parecer incompleta en sus principios por no darle nombre y apellido a cr&iacute;menes tan atroces como &eacute;stos. En definitiva, el intento del estado de penalizar estas conductas se queda corto en sus prop&oacute;sitos por no hacer una legislaci&oacute;n especializada que atienda a los pormenores del tema, que obligue a los funcionarios del estado a utilizarla en los casos indicados y sirva de disuasivo a los posibles delincuentes.</p>
<p>
	Los cr&iacute;menes de odio son el resultado de la educaci&oacute;n social deformada, el aval a la intolerancia, y el ensalzamiento de la diferencia y la clasificaci&oacute;n en vez de resaltar la diversidad y la inclusi&oacute;n. Aunque nuestra legislaci&oacute;n provee para que estas conductas sean erradicadas poco a poco, el estado es el agente responsable de mover la maquinaria de la justicia para obligar a los ciudadanos a educarse y desarrollar ese respeto hacia aquellos que le rodean y no comparten su mismo pensar y estilo de vida.</p>
<p>
	El confeso asesino de Jorge Steven L&oacute;pez enfrentar&aacute; la lectura de acusaci&oacute;n el 8 de marzo de este a&ntilde;o, y el juicio en su fondo comenzar&aacute; en marzo 30.</p>

	&iquest;Qui&eacute;n lleg&oacute; alguna vez a pensar que las historias de Jorge Steven L&oacute;pez Mercado y Matthew Shepard compaginar&iacute;an en alg&uacute;n sentido, en alguna instancia?</p>
<p>
	Ciertamente no fueron personas nacidas en el mismo contexto social y cultural, ni nacieron dentro de familias con similar posici&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica. Mas s&iacute; son v&iacute;ctimas del prejuicio social antes y despu&eacute;s de su muerte. Son v&iacute;ctimas del odio.</p>
<p>
	Matthew Shepard era un joven de 21 a&ntilde;os estudiante de la Universidad de Wyoming, ubicada en la ciudad de Laramie. El 7 de octubre de 1998, Matt (como le dec&iacute;an sus allegados) fue llevado por dos hombres a las afueras de la ciudad de Laramie, donde lo ataron a una verja y lo golpearon hasta dejarlo en estado comatoso. Matt se mantuvo atado a aquella verja por un per&iacute;odo de 18 horas hasta que un ciclista que pasaba por la zona lo encontr&oacute; creyendo que era un espantap&aacute;jaros. El 12 de octubre de ese mismo a&ntilde;o el joven muri&oacute; en un hospital de dicha regi&oacute;n. Los asesinos de Matt, Aaron McKinney y Russel Anderson, fueron ambos condenados a dos cadenas perpetuas consecutivas.</p>
<p>
	Jorge Steven L&oacute;pez Mercado era un joven de 19 a&ntilde;os, residente del municipio de Caguas, Puerto Rico. El 13 de noviembre de 2009, Jorge Steven fue asesinado, decapitado, desmembrado y parcialmente quemado por su asesino confeso. Los hechos ocurrieron en la ciudad de Cayey, Puerto Rico. El juicio sobre el caso de Jorge Steven a&uacute;n no se visto.</p>
<p>
	Comencemos observando las caracter&iacute;sticas m&aacute;s superficiales que pueden establecer similitudes entre ambos. Tanto Jorge Steven como Matt eran j&oacute;venes delgados, de un car&aacute;cter afable, simp&aacute;ticos y muy queridos por sus allegados. Adem&aacute;s eran abiertamente homosexuales y contaban con la aceptaci&oacute;n y apoyo de sus respectivos padres. Ambos j&oacute;venes fueron brutalmente asesinados en una zona alejada del centro de la ciudad.</p>
<p>
	Sin embargo, lo que hace particularmente interesante este tema, son las reacciones posteriores al asesinato por parte de sus asesinos y de la comunidad en general.</p>
<p>
	Los asesinos de Matt confesaron que la golpiza que le dieron era una forma de demostrarle que no se deb&iacute;a meter con los heterosexuales. Por su parte, el asesino de Jorge Steven, Juan Mart&iacute;nez Matos, confes&oacute; que lo asesin&oacute; luego de que se diera cuenta de que era un hombre y no una mujer, sexo con el que supuestamente lo asociaba por la ropa que llevaba puesta. Esto coloca como punto homog&eacute;neo el odio particularizado hacia este sector.</p>
<p>
	Por otro lado, debido a los prejuicios hacia este grupo, de inmediato se levantaron cuestionamientos sobre la moralidad y la inocencia de ambas v&iacute;ctimas. Aunque resulte despreciable tal afirmaci&oacute;n, en el caso de Jorge Steven, el oficial investigador del asesinato, &Aacute;ngel Rodr&iacute;guez Col&oacute;n, adujo p&uacute;blicamente a que la v&iacute;ctima tuvo un grado particular de responsabilidad en lo que sucedi&oacute;. Espec&iacute;ficamente dijo: &ldquo;Este tipo de personas cuando se meten a esto y salen a la calle saben que esto les puede pasar&rdquo;. Por su parte, en el caso de Matt, los argumentos dirigidos a responsabilizar a la v&iacute;ctima establec&iacute;an que &eacute;ste se le insinu&oacute; sexualmente a los asesinos y esto constitu&iacute;a una provocaci&oacute;n que regularmente redundaba en conductas violentas.</p>
<p>
	Ambos cr&iacute;menes tambi&eacute;n generaron cuestionamientos acerca de la orientaci&oacute;n sexual de los asesinos, al punto de que en el caso de Jorge Steven, su asesino pidi&oacute; a la prensa del pa&iacute;s que le dijeran al pueblo que no era homosexual.</p>
<p>
	El asunto del posible uso de drogas por parte de los asesinos tambi&eacute;n es un punto de intersecci&oacute;n de ambos casos. En los medios estadounidenses se discuti&oacute; en varias ocasiones la posible adicci&oacute;n de McKinney a la Metanfetamina, mientras que en el caso de Mart&iacute;nez, se cuestiona si la comisi&oacute;n de tan brutal asesinato estuviera ligada tambi&eacute;n al uso de alguna sustancia controlada como la coca&iacute;na.</p>
<p>
	De otro lado, Mart&iacute;nez confes&oacute; a la polic&iacute;a que mientras cumpl&iacute;a una condena en la c&aacute;rcel por violaci&oacute;n a la ley de violencia dom&eacute;stica, fue abusado sexualmente por alguno de sus compa&ntilde;eros. Por su parte, en el caso de Anderson, este proviene de un hogar que estuvo plagado de problemas de violencia y alcoholismo, mientras que McKinney sufri&oacute; graves problemas de adicci&oacute;n luego de la muerte de su madre. Es el car&aacute;cter escabroso del pasado de los asesinos lo que tambi&eacute;n genera coincidencias en ambos casos.</p>
<p>
	Tanto a Jorge Steven como a Matt los ligaron con el uso de drogas. El caso de Jorge Steven se ha tenido que enfrentar a los rumores de que el joven se prostitu&iacute;a, lo que ha generado un sentimiento de confusi&oacute;n y debate moral en la poblaci&oacute;n. Por su parte, en el caso de Matt, poco tiempo despu&eacute;s de la salvaje golpiza, se descubri&oacute; que el joven estaba contagiado con el virus del HIV y un conocido de Matt expres&oacute; que &eacute;ste le hab&iacute;a manifestado su deseo de suicidarse.</p>
<p>
	Todos estos elementos hacen de dichos eventos unos plagados de cuestionamientos sociales y justificaciones vagas en cuanto al proceder de los victimarios, pero que definitivamente crean duda en aquellos sectores de la sociedad profundamente sumergidos en ciertas concepciones religiosas y morales que a veces tienen m&aacute;s peso que la violencia misma.</p>
<p>
	Gay Panic Defense</p>
<p>
	El &ldquo;gay panic defense&rdquo; es una defensa jur&iacute;dica que busca establecer que el asesino tuvo un lapso de locura atado a un estado de violencia que provoc&oacute; que perpetrara el ataque. Dicha defensa nace de la d&eacute;bil teor&iacute;a psiqui&aacute;trica esbozada por el doctor Edward J. Kempf en 1920. La teor&iacute;a establece que la persona sufre una breve sicosis que le genera alucinaciones y reacciones violentas en la cual acusa a otras personas de la comisi&oacute;n de actos homosexuales.</p>
<p>
	No obstante, dicha defensa no ha podido configurarse de forma homog&eacute;nea y s&oacute;lida en los distintos foros de los Estados Unidos en los que se ha planteado.</p>
<p>
	Aaron McKinney levant&oacute; en juicio dicha defensa al alegar que golpe&oacute; a Matt porque &eacute;ste le acarici&oacute; su muslo en direcci&oacute;n hacia sus genitales, sin embargo la corte rechaz&oacute; este argumento.</p>
<p>
	En el caso de Mart&iacute;nez, de sus declaraciones se desprende la misma defensa. El presunto asesino manifest&oacute; que el recuerdo del incidente en la c&aacute;rcel lo llev&oacute; a perpetrar tan cruento acto cuando se percat&oacute; de que Jorge Steven era un hombre y no una mujer. A&uacute;n queda por ver si los abogados de defensa esbozaran dicho argumento en la corte local.</p>
<p>
	A pesar de la abundante coincidencia en las circunstancias que rodean los casos y el an&aacute;lisis moral y religioso que desvirt&uacute;a los sucesos, tambi&eacute;n ha habido un lado de concordancia desde el punto de vista positivo: la reacci&oacute;n de la prensa y la comunidad ante un crimen de esta envergadura. Tanto en el caso de Matt como en el de Jorge Steven, la cobertura medi&aacute;tica ha sido intensa, y la comunidad homosexual y en general se ha desbordado en expresiones de repudio hacia dichos cr&iacute;menes por medio de manifestaciones, marchas y vigilias.</p>
<p>
	En resumidas cuentas, tanto los elementos positivos como negativos del comportamiento reaccionario que generan estos tristes pero importantes sucesos, ayudan a darle un matiz homog&eacute;neo al an&aacute;lisis y a entender que los prejuicios y discusiones p&uacute;blicas son muy parecidas en las distintas comunidades.</p>

	Como el de Matthew Shepard, el cuerpo de Jorge Steven L&oacute;pez va generando su fuerza m&iacute;tica. El joven que le da el nombre a la ley contra el crimen de odio firmada recientemente por el presidente Obama apareci&oacute; casi muerto en un pastizal de Laramie, Wyoming. Estaba tan desfigurado por los golpes propinados por los dos j&oacute;venes que lo apalearon, que los que lo encontraron moribundo creyeron que se trataba de un espantap&aacute;jaros. De los hechos se desprende que a Matthew lo mataron por ser homosexual. En su defensa, los abogados de los asesinos confesos alegaron que los acusados hab&iacute;an sido v&iacute;ctimas del &ldquo;p&aacute;nico homosexual&rdquo;. Jorge Steven, un adolescente de diecinueve a&ntilde;os, fue asesinado tambi&eacute;n por otro joven, Juan Jos&eacute; Mart&iacute;nez Matos, quien alegadamente le pag&oacute; (o no le pag&oacute;) por sostener relaciones sexuales. El encuentro culmin&oacute; en el salvaje asesinato del muchacho, cuyo cuerpo fue apu&ntilde;aleado, desmembrado, parcialmente calcinado y sus pedazos abandonados en el monte de Guavate en Cayey. Juan Jos&eacute;, el asesino confeso, ha expresado que fue enga&ntilde;ado por Jorge Steven, quien supuestamente &ldquo;se hac&iacute;a pasar&rdquo; por una mujer la noche de los hechos. A Matthew lo matan por ser quien era. A Jorge Steven, alegadamente, por no ser quien dec&iacute;a ser.</p>
<p>
	Dos cuerpos de dos adolescentes homosexuales y bellos, espantosamente asesinados. Al igual que el de Matthew en Estados Unidos, el de Jorge Steven ha terminado ocupando un lugar central en la lucha por los derechos gays en Puerto Rico, en un momento en que el issue del matrimonio gay va ganando un momentum decisivo en buena parte de Europa, en algunos pa&iacute;ses de Latinoam&eacute;rica y en un pu&ntilde;ado de estados americanos . La posibilidad de procesar a Juan Jos&eacute; bajo la ley del crimen de odio le dar&iacute;a mayor dignidad al cuerpo homosexual en la isla. Este punto es crucial: el cuerpo muerto de Jorge Steven es una pieza importante para la reivindicaci&oacute;n de los cuerpos homosexuales vivos del pa&iacute;s. Para que esto suceda, es importante que se identifique la verdadera v&iacute;ctima de este crimen. La v&iacute;ctima no es el asesino, como suelen alegar los que usan la defensa del p&aacute;nico homosexual, sino el homosexual.</p>
<p>
	El proceso de victimizaci&oacute;n del cuerpo de Jorge Steven se ha ido articulando en los &uacute;ltimos meses en Puerto Rico con una claridad, una consecuencia y una determinaci&oacute;n nunca antes vista. Cuando en las d&eacute;cadas del setenta y del ochenta ocurr&iacute;an cr&iacute;menes parecidos contra homosexuales, como el de Iv&aacute;n Frontera, perpetrado por un asesino en serie llamado &ldquo;el &aacute;ngel de los gays&rdquo;, la noticia no pasaba de ocupar los bajos fondos de la prensa amarilla destinada a los cr&iacute;menes pasionales. El &uacute;nico efecto que tuvo la muerte de Ivan Frontera, un periodista de la moda y los modales sociales, fue que Sunshine Logro&ntilde;o, que hab&iacute;a desarrollado un personaje, Ivan Fontecha, que satirizaba los manerismos de Frontera, decidi&oacute; retirarlo de su repertorio de comediante. Ir&oacute;nicamente, Logro&ntilde;o le neg&oacute; con este gesto a Frontera su &uacute;ltima posibilidad de sobrevivencia.</p>
<p>
	Pero el caso de Jorge Steven ha sido muy distinto. La noticia de su muerte y el proceso contra su asesino, que se encuentra a&uacute;n en una etapa incipiente, han recibido una gran cobertura local y ha habido intentos de incorporar la noticia en un &aacute;mbito m&aacute;s globalizado. Se han hecho vigilias para recordar su vida en Puerto Rico y en Nueva York, hay numerosos testimonios de amigos y admiradores en You Tube y se han hecho varios memoriales f&iacute;lmicos celebrando su vida con fotos, an&eacute;cdotas, testimonios y diversas declaraciones de activistas gay de la isla y de Estados Unidos.</p>
<p>
	Nadie se ha dedicado a esta causa con mayor empe&ntilde;o y dedicaci&oacute;n que Pedro Julio Serrano, quien ha convertido la muerte de Jorge Steven pr&aacute;cticamente en el eje de su posicionamiento como el principal activista de los derechos LGBTT en Puerto Rico. Pedro Julio, quien es el actual gerente de comunicaciones del National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, una organizaci&oacute;n de escala nacional entre los lobbies pol&iacute;ticos principales del gobierno federal, intent&oacute; hace unos a&ntilde;os infructuosamente un esca&ntilde;o en la legislatura con el PNP y &uacute;ltimamente se ha convertido en un f&eacute;rreo defensor del matrimonio gay y de la igualdad constitucional de las minor&iacute;as sexuales. Nadie explica con mayor elocuencia y vigor el derecho que nos corresponde a los gays de ser tratados con absoluta igualdad como ciudadanos en buena lid de una sociedad puertorrique&ntilde;a que de una vez y por todas tiene que ser para todos. As&iacute; se llama su organizaci&oacute;n de base: Puerto Rico para tod@s, usando el s&iacute;mbolo de la arroba para implantar en el espacio gramatical de un g&eacute;nero, los dos.</p>
<p>
	El d&iacute;a del velorio de Jorge Steven en la Funeraria D&iacute;az en Toa Alta, mi compa&ntilde;ero y yo fuimos con unos amigos a hacer presencia. La muerte del muchacho nos hab&iacute;a conmovido como a tantos y nos sentimos convocados como miembros de la comunidad LGBTT de este pa&iacute;s. La capilla A, humilde y peque&ntilde;a, estaba abarrotada de sus familiares y amigos. Un grupo tuvimos que quedarnos de pie en la puerta de entrada. Al poco tiempo de llegar nosotros, se aparece Pedro Julio, quien entra y se sienta en el piso, justo frente al altar improvisado donde se hab&iacute;an colocado en la pared numerosos retratos de Jorge Steven y de sus amigos. Uno de los hermanos de Jorge presenta a la predicadora del evento, una mujer de entre treinta y cuarenta a&ntilde;os, quien se present&oacute; como una ex adicta reformada por la Palabra de Dios. Nos cont&oacute; parte de su testimonio y nos dijo que por causa de su vicio lleg&oacute; a convertirse en una deambulante, por lo que tuvo que entregarle sus hijos al gobierno. Su proceso de transformaci&oacute;n, producido por este encuentro con la religi&oacute;n, le permiti&oacute; una nueva vida re-socializada, una vida para la que reclam&oacute; el regreso de sus hijos. Sus dos hijos, que volvieron a vivir con ella, estaban all&iacute;. Ella los llam&oacute; al frente de la capilla y nos los present&oacute; con orgullo como sus dos hijos homosexuales. Su testimonio termina de una manera bastante dram&aacute;tica: por la homosexualidad de sus hijos, tuvo que abandonar su congregaci&oacute;n. Su iglesia la aceptaba a ella, pero no a sus hijos gay. Cuando la predicadora termin&oacute; de hablar, algunos estaban llorando.</p>
<p>
	Despu&eacute;s de este primer acto, le toca el turno a Pedro Julio. Sus palabras fueron firmes y conmovedoras. &ldquo;El pecado no es la homosexualidad&rdquo;, dice. &ldquo;El pecado es la homofobia&rdquo;. &ldquo;El pecado es la intolerancia, es la violencia del silencio&rdquo;. Pedro Julio usa el lenguaje religioso del pecado, pero no lo usa como un religioso, sino como un pol&iacute;tico. Cuando dice pecado quiere decir la falta, el problema, el issue. &ldquo;El silencio de los pol&iacute;ticos, (contin&uacute;a) ninguno de los cuales se ha dignado a darle una condolencia a la madre de Jorge Steven, es un silencio ensordecedor&rdquo;. &ldquo;Hace unos d&iacute;as fui testigo de otro silencio. Estaba en una discoteca gay y le dedicaron all&iacute; un minuto de silencio a Jorge Steven. Un minuto de silencio en una discoteca. Dos silencios muy distintos.&rdquo; Un minuto de silencio en una discoteca gay , pensaba yo para mis adentros. He ah&iacute; un verdadero milagro.</p>
<p>
	Pedro Julio Serrano tiene las cualidades para ser una gran figura pol&iacute;tica de este pa&iacute;s. Habla con convicci&oacute;n. Se expresa con claridad de prop&oacute;sito y tiene un mensaje genuino y de capital importancia. La muerte de Jorge Steven, tan desgraciada y a destiempo, puede, sin embargo, ser la clave para propiciar el conocimiento m&aacute;s profundo y cercano de una figura tan interesante y prometedora como Pedro Julio. Su estilo juvenil y franco, sin ser nunca trivial ni confianzudo, lo presenta como un nuevo tipo de pol&iacute;tico en el escenario puertorrique&ntilde;o, tan empobrecido estos &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os por los pol&iacute;ticos de medio pelo que genera la cansada y trillada pol&iacute;tica partidista, que ya dio lo que iba a dar. Ojala y que figuras como Pedro Julio y sobre todo el electorado nuestro se den cuenta que el futuro de lo pol&iacute;tico en este pa&iacute;s no radica ya en los partidos. Hay que escuchar las propuestas minoritarias de los homosexuales, de las mujeres, de los sindicalistas, de los ambientalistas. Los defensores del Corredor ecol&oacute;gico del Noreste, Todo Puerto Rico por Puerto Rico, el Movimiento Hostosiano, Puerto Rico para Todos. Ah&iacute; est&aacute; el futuro de la pol&iacute;tica puertorrique&ntilde;a. Ni An&iacute;bal Acevedo, ni Santini, ni Fortu&ntilde;o, ni Rivera Shatz, ni Rub&eacute;n Berr&iacute;os, ninguno tiene mucho que ofrecerle a este pa&iacute;s. Pero figuras como Pedro Julio Serrano s&iacute;. El famoso beso que se dieron &eacute;l y su novio al final de su deposici&oacute;n en la legislatura es de los pocos actos prometedoramente pol&iacute;ticos que han ocurrido en ese augusto recinto en los &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os.</p>
<p>
	No obstante, y no digo esto con arrogancia, sino con cierta melancol&iacute;a, ni Pedro Julio, ni la comunidad gay, ni el activismo LGBTT tienen la capacidad de convocar el verdadero cuerpo de Jorge Steven. De cierto modo, no hay acto m&aacute;s violento contra un cuerpo que el que lo destina al sarc&oacute;fago de la victimizaci&oacute;n. Por otra parte, es cierto y lo reconozco, aunque no lo acepte del todo: hab&iacute;a que arrebatarle el cuerpo del joven al asesino, hab&iacute;a que sacarlo de sus manos, para que no lo siguiera desmembrando, hab&iacute;a que restituirlo como un cuerpo &iacute;ntegro, un cuerpo unido, coherente, legible, un cuerpo que pudiese restituirse para la ley y el orden, un cuerpo correcto que se dejase re-civilizar. Ese es el cuerpo de la v&iacute;ctima del crimen de odio. Para que la v&iacute;ctima ocupe su lugar, se precisa que el victimario ocupe el suyo. La repartici&oacute;n del elenco en este drama es implacable. Y la luz del escenario tiene que enfocarse sobre ese cuerpo re-membrado, (rememorado y re-unificado) el cuerpo del nuevo sujeto pol&iacute;tico del siglo veintiuno: el cuerpo LGBTT.</p>
<p>
	El drama que se urde en este proceso es el de los derechos gay. Es un drama importante. Me conmueve lo que hemos logrado en Espa&ntilde;a, en Holanda, en Vermont. Me conmueve la pol&iacute;tica pro-gay de Evo Morales. Pero no puedo olvidar que las dos causas principales de la lucha gay en Estados Unidos, el matrimonio gay y la participaci&oacute;n en el ej&eacute;rcito, son causas, admit&aacute;moslo, bastante conservadoras. El derecho al matrimonio es, de hecho, el derecho al divorcio. La cifra de parejas gay que ya se ha divorciado acabando de casarse es alarmante. Los gays nos hemos empecinado en defender y tratar de salvar dos de las instituciones m&aacute;s cuestionables de la sociedad occidental: el matrimonio burgu&eacute;s y el ej&eacute;rcito imperialista.</p>
<p>
	Por ello mi melancol&iacute;a no se conforma con el cuerpo-v&iacute;ctima de Jorge Steven en aras de la causa gay. Es obvio que el impacto de ese cuerpo en su asesino tiene un tama&ntilde;o mucho m&aacute;s descomunal que el tama&ntilde;o del odio seg&uacute;n lo define el c&oacute;digo penal. &iquest;Qu&eacute; era lo que quer&iacute;a matar, lo que quer&iacute;a hacer desaparecer Juan Jos&eacute; con un pu&ntilde;al, con fuego, con el desmembramiento, un desmembramiento que en vez de deshacerse del cuerpo lo que hizo efectivamente fue multiplicarlo, recomponerlo, aumentarlo en una progresi&oacute;n geom&eacute;trica? Un cuerpo que, lejos de desaparecer, lo que hizo fue esparcirse por el monte de Guavate, crecer y descoyuntarse para incriminarlo desde los lugares m&aacute;s rec&oacute;nditos del bosque. &iquest;Qu&eacute; fue lo que Juan Jos&eacute; no pudo matar?</p>
<p>
	De los muchos testimonios que abundan en you tube y en la prensa sobre Jorge Steven, la causa gay se ha centrado en los que lo presentan como un muchacho bueno, trabajador, obediente, lleno de alegr&iacute;a y de deseos de vivir. La madre destaca su bondad. Algunos amigos hasta lo dibujan como un angelito. Es como si la v&iacute;ctima, para que funcione verdaderamente, tuviese que ser la nena buena, una Barbie hogare&ntilde;a y dulce. Pero hay otros testimonios en you tube, sobre todo los de sus amigas dragas de discoteca, que le han dedicado unos numeritos de apaga y v&aacute;monos. Est&aacute;n los de la April, la Queen Be Ho y la draga que le canta &ldquo;The Wind Beneath my Wings&rdquo; de Bette Midler con toda la dignidad del mundo. Tan pronto termina de cantar, invita a la audiencia de la Disco a que le guarde un minuto de silencio. (El mismo al que alude Pedro Julio). Pero lo interesante viene despu&eacute;s. Tan pronto termina el minuto, lanza una mirada c&oacute;mplice y zafia y un grito rompe pecho: &ldquo;ahora si, como a &eacute;l le gustaba, &iexcl;que se oiga pa&rsquo;l cielo, pu&ntilde;eta! &ldquo; Otro de mis videos favoritos: el amiguito que le dedica un testimonio con sus retratos entra&ntilde;ables al comp&aacute;s de la canci&oacute;n Bad Romance de Lady Gaga, con su corillo insistente y trepidante: Work it Homo Freak Bitch!</p>
<p>
	Es en las fotos de Jorge Steven donde se me aparece su verdadero cuerpo, su cuerpo fierce. Sus labios rojos, carnosos, sus pelos, (el rojo fuego es mi favorito), sus cejas sacadas, su strike a pose con dos dedos enmarc&aacute;ndole un ojo. Es obvio que Jorge Steven no era la Caperucita Roja. Era la Alpha Bitch de una jaur&iacute;a fierce. Ese es el cuerpo que su asesino quiso desaparecer. El cuerpo del deseo. De su deseo. Y s&oacute;lo logr&oacute; despedazarlo y multiplicarlo. Un cuerpo que deviene animal. Un cuerpo que deviene mujer. Un cuerpo fascinante, poderoso y peligroso.</p>
<p>
	La lucha gay ha culminado en un proyecto pol&iacute;tico liberal: la b&uacute;squeda de la igualdad. La igualdad de derechos. De este modo se inserta en el movimiento de los derechos civiles, la m&aacute;xima aportaci&oacute;n de la pol&iacute;tica liberal en occidente. Pero lo pol&iacute;tico no se extingue en la b&uacute;squeda de la igualdad. Su modo m&aacute;s radical es, de hecho, la defensa de la diferencia. El cuerpo que da miedo, porque fascina y aturde, es el cuerpo de la diferencia. Ese cuerpo no es ni femenino ni masculino. Es un cuerpo trans. La verdadera fobia no es, en el fondo, la homofobia. Es la transfobia, la fobia a un cuerpo l&iacute;mite, poroso, un cuerpo m&uacute;ltiple y en constante devenir, como el de una jaur&iacute;a. Ese es el cuerpo leg&iacute;timamente pol&iacute;tico que hay que defender, incluso defenderlo de la pol&iacute;tica de los derechos civiles. Un cuerpo desnudo, insolente, vol&aacute;til. Un homo freak bitch.</p>

Su testimonio termina de una manera bastante dram&aacute;tica: por la homosexualidad de sus hijos, tuvo que abandonar su congregaci&oacute;n. Su iglesia la aceptaba a ella, pero no a sus hijos gay. Cuando la predicadora termin&oacute; de hablar, algunos estaban llorando.</p>
<p>
	Despu&eacute;s de este primer acto, le toca el turno a Pedro Julio. Sus palabras fueron firmes y conmovedoras. &ldquo;El pecado no es la homosexualidad&rdquo;, dice. &ldquo;El pecado es la homofobia&rdquo;. &ldquo;El pecado es la intolerancia, es la violencia del silencio&rdquo;. Pedro Julio usa el lenguaje religioso del pecado, pero no lo usa como un religioso, sino como un pol&iacute;tico. Cuando dice pecado quiere decir la falta, el problema, el issue. &ldquo;El silencio de los pol&iacute;ticos, (contin&uacute;a) ninguno de los cuales se ha dignado a darle una condolencia a la madre de Jorge Steven, es un silencio ensordecedor&rdquo;. &ldquo;Hace unos d&iacute;as fui testigo de otro silencio. Estaba en una discoteca gay y le dedicaron all&iacute; un minuto de silencio a Jorge Steven. Un minuto de silencio en una discoteca. Dos silencios muy distintos.&rdquo; Un minuto de silencio en una discoteca gay , pensaba yo para mis adentros. He ah&iacute; un verdadero milagro.</p>
<p>
	Pedro Julio Serrano tiene las cualidades para ser una gran figura pol&iacute;tica de este pa&iacute;s. Habla con convicci&oacute;n. Se expresa con claridad de prop&oacute;sito y tiene un mensaje genuino y de capital importancia. La muerte de Jorge Steven, tan desgraciada y a destiempo, puede, sin embargo, ser la clave para propiciar el conocimiento m&aacute;s profundo y cercano de una figura tan interesante y prometedora como Pedro Julio. Su estilo juvenil y franco, sin ser nunca trivial ni confianzudo, lo presenta como un nuevo tipo de pol&iacute;tico en el escenario puertorrique&ntilde;o, tan empobrecido estos &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os por los pol&iacute;ticos de medio pelo que genera la cansada y trillada pol&iacute;tica partidista, que ya dio lo que iba a dar. Ojala y que figuras como Pedro Julio y sobre todo el electorado nuestro se den cuenta que el futuro de lo pol&iacute;tico en este pa&iacute;s no radica ya en los partidos. Hay que escuchar las propuestas minoritarias de los homosexuales, de las mujeres, de los sindicalistas, de los ambientalistas. Los defensores del Corredor ecol&oacute;gico del Noreste, Todo Puerto Rico por Puerto Rico, el Movimiento Hostosiano, Puerto Rico para Todos. Ah&iacute; est&aacute; el futuro de la pol&iacute;tica puertorrique&ntilde;a. Ni An&iacute;bal Acevedo, ni Santini, ni Fortu&ntilde;o, ni Rivera Shatz, ni Rub&eacute;n Berr&iacute;os, ninguno tiene mucho que ofrecerle a este pa&iacute;s. Pero figuras como Pedro Julio Serrano s&iacute;. El famoso beso que se dieron &eacute;l y su novio al final de su deposici&oacute;n en la legislatura es de los pocos actos prometedoramente pol&iacute;ticos que han ocurrido en ese augusto recinto en los &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os.</p>
<p>
	No obstante, y no digo esto con arrogancia, sino con cierta melancol&iacute;a, ni Pedro Julio, ni la comunidad gay, ni el activismo LGBTT tienen la capacidad de convocar el verdadero cuerpo de Jorge Steven. De cierto modo, no hay acto m&aacute;s violento contra un cuerpo que el que lo destina al sarc&oacute;fago de la victimizaci&oacute;n. Por otra parte, es cierto y lo reconozco, aunque no lo acepte del todo: hab&iacute;a que arrebatarle el cuerpo del joven al asesino, hab&iacute;a que sacarlo de sus manos, para que no lo siguiera desmembrando, hab&iacute;a que restituirlo como un cuerpo &iacute;ntegro, un cuerpo unido, coherente, legible, un cuerpo que pudiese restituirse para la ley y el orden, un cuerpo correcto que se dejase re-civilizar. Ese es el cuerpo de la v&iacute;ctima del crimen de odio. Para que la v&iacute;ctima ocupe su lugar, se precisa que el victimario ocupe el suyo. La repartici&oacute;n del elenco en este drama es implacable. Y la luz del escenario tiene que enfocarse sobre ese cuerpo re-membrado, (rememorado y re-unificado) el cuerpo del nuevo sujeto pol&iacute;tico del siglo veintiuno: el cuerpo LGBTT.</p>
<p>
	El drama que se urde en este proceso es el de los derechos gay. Es un drama importante. Me conmueve lo que hemos logrado en Espa&ntilde;a, en Holanda, en Vermont. Me conmueve la pol&iacute;tica pro-gay de Evo Morales. Pero no puedo olvidar que las dos causas principales de la lucha gay en Estados Unidos, el matrimonio gay y la participaci&oacute;n en el ej&eacute;rcito, son causas, admit&aacute;moslo, bastante conservadoras. El derecho al matrimonio es, de hecho, el derecho al divorcio. La cifra de parejas gay que ya se ha divorciado acabando de casarse es alarmante. Los gays nos hemos empecinado en defender y tratar de salvar dos de las instituciones m&aacute;s cuestionables de la sociedad occidental: el matrimonio burgu&eacute;s y el ej&eacute;rcito imperialista.</p>
<p>
	Por ello mi melancol&iacute;a no se conforma con el cuerpo-v&iacute;ctima de Jorge Steven en aras de la causa gay. Es obvio que el impacto de ese cuerpo en su asesino tiene un tama&ntilde;o mucho m&aacute;s descomunal que el tama&ntilde;o del odio seg&uacute;n lo define el c&oacute;digo penal. &iquest;Qu&eacute; era lo que quer&iacute;a matar, lo que quer&iacute;a hacer desaparecer Juan Jos&eacute; con un pu&ntilde;al, con fuego, con el desmembramiento, un desmembramiento que en vez de deshacerse del cuerpo lo que hizo efectivamente fue multiplicarlo, recomponerlo, aumentarlo en una progresi&oacute;n geom&eacute;trica? Un cuerpo que, lejos de desaparecer, lo que hizo fue esparcirse por el monte de Guavate, crecer y descoyuntarse para incriminarlo desde los lugares m&aacute;s rec&oacute;nditos del bosque. &iquest;Qu&eacute; fue lo que Juan Jos&eacute; no pudo matar?</p>
<p>
	De los muchos testimonios que abundan en you tube y en la prensa sobre Jorge Steven, la causa gay se ha centrado en los que lo presentan como un muchacho bueno, trabajador, obediente, lleno de alegr&iacute;a y de deseos de vivir. La madre destaca su bondad. Algunos amigos hasta lo dibujan como un angelito. Es como si la v&iacute;ctima, para que funcione verdaderamente, tuviese que ser la nena buena, una Barbie hogare&ntilde;a y dulce. Pero hay otros testimonios en you tube, sobre todo los de sus amigas dragas de discoteca, que le han dedicado unos numeritos de apaga y v&aacute;monos. Est&aacute;n los de la April, la Queen Be Ho y la draga que le canta &ldquo;The Wind Beneath my Wings&rdquo; de Bette Midler con toda la dignidad del mundo. Tan pronto termina de cantar, invita a la audiencia de la Disco a que le guarde un minuto de silencio. (El mismo al que alude Pedro Julio). Pero lo interesante viene despu&eacute;s. Tan pronto termina el minuto, lanza una mirada c&oacute;mplice y zafia y un grito rompe pecho: &ldquo;ahora si, como a &eacute;l le gustaba, &iexcl;que se oiga pa&rsquo;l cielo, pu&ntilde;eta! &ldquo; Otro de mis videos favoritos: el amiguito que le dedica un testimonio con sus retratos entra&ntilde;ables al comp&aacute;s de la canci&oacute;n Bad Romance de Lady Gaga, con su corillo insistente y trepidante: Work it Homo Freak Bitch!</p>
<p>
	Es en las fotos de Jorge Steven donde se me aparece su verdadero cuerpo, su cuerpo fierce. Sus labios rojos, carnosos, sus pelos, (el rojo fuego es mi favorito), sus cejas sacadas, su strike a pose con dos dedos enmarc&aacute;ndole un ojo. Es obvio que Jorge Steven no era la Caperucita Roja. Era la Alpha Bitch de una jaur&iacute;a fierce. Ese es el cuerpo que su asesino quiso desaparecer. El cuerpo del deseo. De su deseo. Y s&oacute;lo logr&oacute; despedazarlo y multiplicarlo. Un cuerpo que deviene animal. Un cuerpo que deviene mujer. Un cuerpo fascinante, poderoso y peligroso.</p>
<p>
	La lucha gay ha culminado en un proyecto pol&iacute;tico liberal: la b&uacute;squeda de la igualdad. La igualdad de derechos. De este modo se inserta en el movimiento de los derechos civiles, la m&aacute;xima aportaci&oacute;n de la pol&iacute;tica liberal en occidente. Pero lo pol&iacute;tico no se extingue en la b&uacute;squeda de la igualdad. Su modo m&aacute;s radical es, de hecho, la defensa de la diferencia. El cuerpo que da miedo, porque fascina y aturde, es el cuerpo de la diferencia. Ese cuerpo no es ni femenino ni masculino. Es un cuerpo trans. La verdadera fobia no es, en el fondo, la homofobia. Es la transfobia, la fobia a un cuerpo l&iacute;mite, poroso, un cuerpo m&uacute;ltiple y en constante devenir, como el de una jaur&iacute;a. Ese es el cuerpo leg&iacute;timamente pol&iacute;tico que hay que defender, incluso defenderlo de la pol&iacute;tica de los derechos civiles. Un cuerpo desnudo, insolente, vol&aacute;til. Un homo freak bitch.</p>

<p>
	On August 28, 2010, my partner, a friend, and I drove from our home in Charlottesville, VA to attend the Reclaim the Dream rally in Washington, D.C. to commemorate the 47th anniversary of Martin Luther King, Jr.&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;I Have a Dream Speech.&rdquo; This rally, organized by Al Sharpton&rsquo;s National Action Network, was called in response to Glenn Beck&rsquo;s Restoring Honor rally that was being held on the National Mall, the same site as King&rsquo;s original speech.</p>
<p>
	Beck claimed that his choice of August 28 was a divine coincidence, and that he hadn&rsquo;t intentionally chosen to hold his rally on the same day as King&rsquo;s speech. However, what I witnessed of Beck&rsquo;s rally assured me that it was explicitly designed to replace the set of signs and symbols associated with King&rsquo;s speech with a new set of signs and symbols in the national imaginary.</p>
<p>
	Specifically, Beck&rsquo;s rally was designed to extend the fantasy of the U.S. as a wounded national homeland that was propagated by the State after the events of 9/11. The most haunting image of this fantasy was the face of the final speaker at Beck&rsquo;s rally, David Roever, a Vietnam veteran and preacher, who offered a closing benediction. As Beck told the audience, Roever was heinously disfigured during the Vietnam War when a phosphorus grenade that he had intended to throw at the enemy exploded in his hand.</p>
<p>
	Beck regaled the crowd with the story of how Roever, recovering in a military hospital and suffering from excruciating pain, buried his face in his pillow to hide his tears, only to realize when he turned over that the skin on his face had literally ripped off. The goal of Beck&rsquo;s rally was to replace Martin Luther King, Jr.&rsquo;s face, standing in here as a proxy for Barack Obama&rsquo;s face, with David Roever&rsquo;s face as the face of the nation.</p>
<p>
	Such a fantastic displacement was intended, in turn, to replace Obama&rsquo;s hopeful national agenda with a melancholic one unable to accept its loss of symbolic privilege. I can think of no more potent example of the right wing&rsquo;s attempt to shift the national imaginary back to a pre-Obama everyday than the fantastic distortions that took place at Beck&rsquo;s rally.<br />

	Just moments after the polls closed in New York State, Carl Paladino, the Republican candidate for Governor, took to the podium to deliver his concession speech to now Governor-elect Andrew Cuomo. Armed with a bright orange baseball bat, he growled that he had promised to take a baseball bat to Albany&hellip; that the bat was his metaphor for the people and that now Cuomo could take the bat with him or ignore it at his peril. Posing with the bat &ndash; and he was certainly posing for the camera &ndash; he threatened rather than congratulated Cuomo with a menacing, bat-wielding stare. This was not a concession, this was an aggressive and explicit threat.&nbsp; However, while Paladino&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mad as Hell&rdquo; routine may have allowed him to roll over Rick Lazio in the Republican primary, it did not play well with the majority of voters in the Empire State. He lost by almost thirty points; few New Yorkers, it seems, wanted to be the bat. &nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Indeed, the bat seems like an odd metaphor employed in this way.&nbsp; This is a thug&rsquo;s bat, not a child&rsquo;s toy or an emblem of America&rsquo;s favorite pastime.&nbsp; Paladino&rsquo;s loss was a bright spot for me on a devastating election night. His politics of anger may have been a successful early rallying cry for the Tea Party, but it was not a winning electoral strategy. Similarly, Sharron Angle, Christine O&rsquo;Donnell, and Linda McMahon all lost their bids in part, I think, because they could not articulate platforms beyond the bat or the batty.&nbsp; Yet one third of Tea Party candidates, many with more fully articulated platforms than O&rsquo;Donnell, Angle, or Paladino, did win elections in other states in campaigns often funded by a handful of behind the scenes billionaires.&nbsp; These are the aggressive and explicit threats we need to take seriously. This isn&rsquo;t crazy Carl with a baseball bat or Christine O&rsquo;Donnell with a broomstick.&nbsp; These mad-as-hell candidates &ndash; and their wealthy patrons &ndash; may very well succeed in overturning the health care bill, passing laws for fetal personhood, and further paralyzing the Democratic Senate and the Obama White House. &nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	In the past few days a number of people have sent me the link to the website http://whatthefuckhasobamadonesofar.com/.&nbsp; Each time you visit the site it lists something that the Obama administration has actually accomplished. These include achievements such as &ldquo;Signed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, giving the FDA the authority to regulate the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of tobacco for the first time&rdquo;; &ldquo;Appointed more openly gay workers to government positions&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, restoring basic protections against pay discrimination for women and other workers.&rdquo; Most of these statements end with the tag line, &ldquo;Big fucking deal, what else?&rdquo;&nbsp; But these are big fucking deals.&nbsp; However, they&rsquo;ve been lost in the media hysteria over the Tea Party and its followers. &nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	It is time for the left to get mad as hell and to fight back, not with baseball bats but armed with the rhetoric that articulates legislative accomplishments that have improved the lives of middle class and working class Americans.<br />

	You can spend weeks wandering the vast mediascape and not see a sea of middle-aged, middle-American whiteness like a Tea Party rally.&nbsp; Over the past fifty years, partly out of political concern, partly out of some desire to accurately represent the changing face of America, but mostly in an attempt to reach as broad an audience as possible, the culture industry has largely rejected such bland homogeneity. The starring roles in most hit dramas still go to the straight white guy and girl, but the show would seem incomplete without a couple co-stars of a different color. And while whites still dominate positions of factual authority in the mass media, every local newscast has their &ldquo;other&rdquo; anchor.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been a long journey from the novelty of Nat King Cole in the mid 1950s to the routinized multi-hued casting of&nbsp; a show like today&rsquo;s Survivor, but what the American audience watches, and thus how they see their world and imagine its possibilities, has been irrevocably altered. &ldquo;Difference&rdquo; is no longer different, and diversity, albeit in its most banal form, is what Americans have come to expect. Beneath this ethereal media rainbow there used to be places were one might reliably find jowly white guys playing prominent roles, one of them being the nation&rsquo;s capital. Then came the Obama not-so-White House.<br />
	<br />
	&ldquo;Take our country back!&rdquo; is a cry you&rsquo;ll hear at a Tea Party protest. Back. Back to a time when white people were firmly in power and those of other ethnicities knew their place.&nbsp; But also back to an imaginary America that was almost entirely white as well. Back to <em>Leave it to Beaver</em>, <em>My Three Sons</em>, and <em>The Waltons</em>. But Fred MacMurray no longer has cultural currency; today&rsquo;s media fantasies are in living color. Tea Party rallies &ndash; the costumes, the outrage, the provocative rhetoric -- are so theatrical because they are theatre: a way for a dying strain of white people to represent themselves in a mediated world that no longer recognizes them. &nbsp;<br />

	For all the ballyhoo about the Tea Party and its potential impact on the future direction of America, the reality is that its influence will almost certainly be minimal.&nbsp; And the irony is that this became reality almost the very minute that the Republicans jumped on the bandwagon.<br />
	<br />
	Even though Tea Party leaders are seeking to flex their muscles now that the election is over, they will be mostly shut out of the Republican leadership and will struggle to enact their legislative agenda.&nbsp; Incoming Speaker of the House John Boehner embraced the Tea Party during this past election cycle, but his platform for legislative change, &ldquo;A Pledge to America,&rdquo; is essentially a rehash of the Contract with America that Newt Gingrich proposed in 1994.&nbsp; Boehner is neither proposing nor endorsing new ideas (though he has given them a &ndash; slightly &ndash; different title page). One third of Tea Party candidates won election, which would mark a highly significant movement of a third party. However, although the Tea Party originated as a grassroots movement spurred on by disenchanted citizens meeting at the local Starbucks or Applebees, the Republican Party craftily coopted its energy as a symbol of dissatisfaction with the legislative agenda of the Democratic-led Congress and White House.&nbsp; Photographs of the House leadership focus on Boehner, Eric Cantor, and Kevin McCarthy, all of whom were happy to capitalize on Tea Party rhetoric during the election but none of whom are actually closely aligned with the movement itself. &nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Tea Party candidates, for the most part, ran on Republican Party lines and the reality is that most Tea Partiers who won election will be new to Congress and will not have plum committee assignments.&nbsp; Michelle Bachmann, a leading voice of the Tea Party at rallies and especially on cable television, has fundraising clout and is seeking a leadership role among House Republicans, but she is given very little chance to actually win that role. And while Dick Armey and Sarah Palin may try to wield power through the medium of cable television, neither of them any longer holds political office and there isn&rsquo;t another election for them to influence for another two years. &nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Consider how difficult it has been for President Obama to enact the legislative goals he articulated in his campaign for President &ndash; and he was trying to do so while the Democrats controlled all of Congress.&nbsp; There is always a wide gap between campaign rhetoric and legislative action. The Tea Party may have evolved into a powerhouse in this campaign because Republican leaders adopted its rhetoric as a means of attacking Democratic leadership.&nbsp; But that very embrace is what threatens to delimit the Tea Party&rsquo;s impact. Unless they learn how to be effective legislators who can win over their colleagues through persuasion and compromise and not through expressions of anger, Tea Partiers risk marginalization at the hands of the Republican Party itself.</p>

<p>
	Looking from over the Canadian border (from a country obsessed with the USA, as was Britain in its own way), this political phenomenon seems largely manufactured by the media and, as such, all too &quot;real.&quot; If you know what I mean. They will surely get tons of attention and power with the election. They (meaning a very loose and contentious semi-coalition formed largely by a few venal right wingers with money and by the media) will surely attack each other from within and not last very long as a coalition, if one can even say they are.<br />
	<br />
	That said, I couldn&#39;t agree more about the suggestion about how naive the &quot;left&quot; (whatever that means in a place like the US; I really don&#39;t know any more) has been routinely about how power works and what to do about non-progressive political ideologies and the forces that wield them.<br />
	<br />
	There is no &quot;left&quot; left except a bunch of liberals like us who want to maintain our lifestyles and won&#39;t really take any risks.&nbsp; No one knows how to take risks any more--late capitalism has made any sense that there is a clear opposition or a clear way to oppose what goes on obscure.<br />
	<br />
	The only people I can see really making a difference in a progressive sense are those who buck the system by going to places where people really need help. It seems to me there are more and more entrepreneurial young people willing to do this. Working within established systems these days seems a dead end.</p>

<p>
	I have to admire some of the people on the street attaching themselves to the &quot;tea party&quot; banner. They are right to be angry. They are at least taking action. They are, in my opinion, completely and totally wrong-headed about the actual politics embedded in the action--as usual they have bought the line that will defeat their very own interests (Reagan and Thatcher had that down).&nbsp; The so-called leaders I loathe in a way I can only remember feeling at the depths of Reagan&#39;s tenure when he blatantly lied about the &quot;weapons&quot; in Nicaragua and Bush&#39;s tenure when he had Colin Powell blatantly lie about the &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; in Iraq.</p>
<p>
	Well, the motley &quot;coalition&quot; that the media and big-money manipulators are calling the Tea Party seems to have gained momentary &quot;power&quot; in the Congress. Perhaps now the irony of people running for GOVERNMENT positions on a platform of being ANTI-GOVERNMENT will come to roost. They will see just how hard it is to get anything done. Here is where the weight of the dead hand of bureaucracy will turn in favor of progressives!<br />
	Otherwise, if there is a progressive coalition, it (we) must look to their strategies of firing people up. And please, people, can we stop blaming Obama? Is it his fault he didn&#39;t turn out to be the &quot;second coming&quot;?</p>

	In an increasingly violent world where the &ldquo;present crisis of neoliberal circulation has now become interactive with the climate crisis&rdquo;<a href=""#_edn1"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[i]</a> threatening to flood both small island nations in the Pacific and major cities like New Orleans and New York, people living in the neo-liberally transfigured world seem to have forgotten how dependent we are on water.&nbsp; Over the course of its history, capitalism has increasingly commodified this liquid life-blood changing its character from that of a commons for both humans and nonhumans into that of a privatized marketable resource<a href=""#_edn2"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[ii]</a>.&nbsp; As discussed by Tara Haskins in another post on this cluster, we now simply drink it, pollute it, and flush it, for pennies a litre, to sanitation facilities that most of us never see, miles and miles away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Our relationship to wetlands in this system is similar.&nbsp; These critical habitats can act as the primary defense against powerful storm surges for those living in low-lying areas while simultaneously mitigating the effects of climate change through carbon capturing.&nbsp; Yet, though we could be working to preserve and to expand wetlands, perhaps to avoid our fear of the rising waters induced by climate change and the necessary adjustments they entail, we continue to bury these vibrant ecosystems, quite literally, to serve the flight of capital.&nbsp; All three major airports in the New York City area, for example, are built on filled in coastal marshland<a href=""#_edn3"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[iii]</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	When considering the effects of global climate change, our shared future seems bleak, and in discussing it, one often encounters a certain ambivalence emerging not out of total ignorance, but from a sense of paralysis and despair.&nbsp; As the climate changes, though, we must change our relationship to wetlands if we wish to live in a stable biosphere.&nbsp; But how might we accomplish this task?</p>
<p>
	Before venturing any answers to this question, I want to tell you about why I became obsessed with frogs.&nbsp; I need you to know how it is that they called me to join them in the water, how it is that they called me to become amphibious &ndash; which I define, for the purposes of this post, as either living in a wetland or actively working for wetlands&rsquo; survival through political action.&nbsp; Perhaps, by telling you this story, my words will act as a medium through which these amphibians might call you, too.</p>
<p>
	In August of 2009, I attended a conference in Bogot&aacute; Colombia and while walking the sidewalks of the city, I could not help but notice the presence, or more often than not, the potentially ankle-twisting absence, of municipal utility grate covers, for hydro and water lines, leading into buildings at regularly spaced intervals; these grate covers were often ensconced with the image of a frog.&nbsp; This phenomenon puzzled me, as I couldn&rsquo;t understand what possible connection this sprawling urban landscape might have to frogs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where would a frog live around here?&rdquo; I thought to myself. There didn&rsquo;t seem to be any streams, rivers, or marshlands nearby.&nbsp; Later, on a walking tour of the city<a href=""#_edn4"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[iv]</a>, I learned that at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, nearly every stream, river, and lagoon in Bogot&aacute; had been buried in order both to deal with the smell coming from their industrially polluted waters, and to generate revenues from the sale of new downtown real estate.&nbsp; This revelation piqued my curiosity because, though I wasn&rsquo;t sure where, I had heard this story before.&nbsp; I started to wonder, &ldquo;What other cities have buried their wetlands?&nbsp; From where else have frogs disappeared?&rdquo;&nbsp; And when I returned home to New York, I soon encountered answers I did not expect.</p>
<p>
	Whether providential or simply a coincidence, my investigations into the disappearances of frogs and their wetland homes were made infinitely easier by two exhibits held in New York City last fall, as well as by the guidance of knowledgeable faculty members at NYU<a href=""#_edn5"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[v]</a>. <em>Mapping New York&rsquo;s Shoreline 1609-2009: celebrating the quadrientennial of Henry Hudson&rsquo;s exploration of the waterways of New York, </em>hosted by the New York Public Library, provided me with a glimpse into the history of wetlands destruction in one of the nations busiest harbours; and <em>Frogs: A Chorus of Colors</em>, curated by the organization Amphibian Ark, at the American Museum of Natural History offered me an image that served as my next beacon. &nbsp;Sitting in a small viewing room watching a blurry screen, I saw a disturbing apparition for the first time: bodies floating in the water.&nbsp; These bodies were the bodies of frogs floating belly up in a Panamanian lagoon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Amphibian populations, globally, have declined by over forty percent in the last fifty years.&nbsp; While much of this decline may be linked to habitat destruction, toxic pollutants, and over exposure to UV radiation, recently scientists have determined that a major factor has been the spread of a lethal fungus known as chytrid<a href=""#_edn6"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[vi]</a>.&nbsp; Studies have demonstrated that this fungus kills frogs by inhibiting their capacity to absorb electrolytes.&nbsp; Without electrolytes, whether one is human or frog, one&rsquo;s muscle functions are impaired as messages are unable to travel throughout one&rsquo;s nervous system.&nbsp;&nbsp; The result: asystolic cardiac arrest.&nbsp; At first, frogs suffering from chytridiomycois experience an irregular heartbeat; then, as the fungus grows their heart stops altogether.&nbsp; The film I watched repeatedly at <em>Frogs</em> outlined the spread of chytridiomycosis around the globe, but it didn&rsquo;t tell me where the fungus originated.&nbsp; To answer this question, I turned to journals and magazine articles and what they told me was both strange and alarming.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spread of the chytrid fungus is directly linked to a history of human interactions with the African Claw Frog.&nbsp; Chytrid is a naturally occurring fungus in the habitat of this species, yet this frog possesses a defense mechanism that other amphibians don&rsquo;t have.&nbsp; A bacterium known as Janthinobacterium lividum lives on its skin and eats any fungus that it encounters<a href=""#_edn7"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[vii]</a>.&nbsp; So how did this fungus escape and kill other amphibians?</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1930s, scientists around the world were searching for a reliable pregnancy test when a South African named Lancelot Hogben discovered that if he injected ox hormones into the dorsal lymph sac of the African Claw Frog, in eight to twelve hours it would produce either eggs or sperm depending on the sex of the frog<a href=""#_edn8"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[viii]</a>.&nbsp; Soon after, scientists adjusted this procedure for humans, injecting female urine into these lymph sacs to test for the presence of pregnancy hormones.&nbsp; If the frog produced eggs or sperm after being injected, the woman was pregnant.</p>
<p>
	Over the next two decades, knowledge of this test spread rapidly throughout the world and thousands of African Claw Frogs were exported from South Africa to pregnancy centers in the Americas, Europe, and Asia.&nbsp; In the 1960s, though, the &ldquo;Hogben test&rdquo; became obsolete as scientists managed to create synthetic substances with which they could test for the pregnancy hormone hCG.&nbsp; Big testing centers housing thousands of frogs closed their doors and humans, once again, became oblivious to the existence of these creatures.&nbsp; But somehow, some of these frogs escaped, and infiltrated other amphibian habitats, carrying the fatal fungus with them<a href=""#_edn9"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[ix]</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	As I considered these circumstances further, however, chytrid fungi spores seemed to be but minor contributors in the overall decline of amphibians.&nbsp; Their deaths seemed irrevocably linked to the spread of another kind of fungus altogether &ndash; that of frontier capitalism<a href=""#_edn10"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[x]</a>.&nbsp; Only, the frontier, in this instance, had moved from the wetland locales of Bogot&aacute; and New York Harbor onto the bodies of frogs themselves.&nbsp; This movement prompted me to ask, &ldquo;Onto what other bodies has the circulation of capital projected a frontier?&rdquo; And I soon received a response to this query too&hellip; from other bodies in the water&hellip; the ghosts of Hurricane Katrina<a href=""#_edn11"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[xi]</a>.</p>
<p>
	This past spring, I watched Spike Lee&rsquo;s film document <em>When the Levees Broke<a href=""#_edn12"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[xii]</a></em>.&nbsp; I could discuss it for pages, but in this context I believe a brief description of two images contained within it will be enough to conjure these ghosts in your mind.&nbsp; The first, a heavy set African American man floating facedown, motionless, in dirty, oily<a href=""#_edn13"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[xiii]</a>, foul water; and the second, a vast coastal marshland habitat carved into deep channels by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in order to facilitate more efficient shipping.&nbsp; As I watched the film, these two images merged in my consciousness and mirrored the images of the frogs that I saw floating belly up in a lagoon.&nbsp; The same capitalist fungus had resulted in the deaths of both frogs and humans.</p>
<p>
	The frogs called me next when I sat down one night in April to watch Disney&rsquo;s new rendition of the classic Brother&rsquo;s Grimm tale &ldquo;The Frog King&rdquo;; this time entitled, <em>The Princess and the Frog<a href=""#_edn14"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[xiv]</a>.&nbsp; </em>With much of the action set in the wetlands in and around New Orleans the movie evoked thoughts of Katrina, but then I noticed something else.&nbsp; The dark green markings on our hero, the transfigured and amphibian Prince Naveen, resembled a particular kind of frog, one that I had been studying.&nbsp; I remembered an e-mail from a person whom I had contacted concerning wetlands in New York City.&nbsp; The subject line read, &ldquo;Save one of Staten Island&rsquo;s last coastal wetlands.&nbsp; Save Arlington Marsh. Stop the New York Container Terminal Expansion Project.&rdquo;&nbsp; As I re-read the e-mail, I realized that New Yorkers are facing a Katrina-type situation, for both frogs and humans, in their own backyard.&nbsp; Staten Island&rsquo;s North Shore encompasses many of the same types of communities that lived in New Orleans pre-Katrina:&nbsp; a marginalized community of color, container shipping, waves soon to rise with rising temperatures, a squadron of United States Army Corps of Engineers bent on dredging channels, and a population of Southern Leopard Frogs.</p>
<p>
	They have not started to dredge Arlington Marsh yet though, so what might we do to prevent a potential catastrophe?&nbsp; What alternatives might we offer?&nbsp; How can we transform this watery landscape, and our relationship to it, through the figure of the frog?&nbsp; Flawed though this Disney movie may be, we might be able to turn to it for help in transforming the cinematic trope of &ldquo;bodies in the water&rdquo;, from one metonymic of being immersed in a larger crisis, constituting what Nicholas Mirzoeff would call an &ldquo;immersed subjectivity&rdquo;<a href=""#_edn15"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[xv]</a>, into an ecologically reparative ontology.&nbsp; The ideological underpinning of this movie and the neo-liberal order that manages conditions along the North Shore are identical.&nbsp; In both instances, a body&rsquo;s social standing in a hierarchical system is constructed as deriving from meritorious actions; in each case, structural inequalities are brushed aside.&nbsp; In Disney&rsquo;s fairytale, Tiana, a hardworking African American woman from New Orleans with big ambitions, is able to become a princess and to have all of her dreams come true, but the fate of the other members of her socially marginalized community remains untold.&nbsp; Looking to Staten Island, we might surmise that, like the hardworking blue collar community that inhabits its North Shore, Tiana&rsquo;s community has seen few of its aspirations fulfilled.&nbsp; Yet still, while transformed into frogs, Tiana and Prince Naveen seem to embody an amphibious mode of agency that was previously unavailable to them. By wading into the swampy Bayou surrounding New Orleans and collaborating with the other creatures that they meet, they manage to act as reparative bodies in the water through reshaping their relationships with the nonhuman world.&nbsp; What might happen if we follow their lead?&nbsp; What if, instead of avoiding the rising water, we wade into it before we are engulfed?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In what remains of this post, I briefly discuss two ways in which immersing ourselves in a watery world with frogs might serve as reparative.&nbsp; First, I examine the frog&rsquo;s relationship to cosmology.&nbsp; Following that, I propose that we advocate for more generative human-human, as well as human-frog, relations through shared habitats.&nbsp; Using the <em>Princess and the Frog</em> and the situation on Staten Islandas touchstones, I argue that living amphibiously, in and through wetlands, may offer one solution to stemming the rising tides while simultaneously addressing social and environmental inequalities.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disney&rsquo;s version of this classic Brothers Grimm tale lies at the nexus of three interweaving cosmologies.&nbsp; I have already referred to the capitalist cosmology of private property and individualized meritorious action for which the film advocates, yet, I believe that the other two cosmologies contained within it may serve as infinitely more generative sites from which to act in the years ahead.&nbsp; Metamorphosis is the central trope of this story, and while capitalist metamorphosis seems intent on transforming <em>away</em> from water, the other two cosmologies presented in the film rely on transformations <em>in</em> and <em>through</em> water.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Robert Farris Thompson describes, the Kongo cosmogram &ndash; from which many of the exoticized vodun, or &ldquo;voodoo&rdquo;, practices in the movie are derived &ndash; uses the sea as a plane of transformation between the world of the living and the world of the dead<a href=""#_edn16"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[xvi]</a>.&nbsp; In this depiction of the universe, circulation between these two worlds is constant, and this cosmology suggests that, though we transform, we remain always already a part of the material world.&nbsp; Working in concert with this understanding, the other cosmological presence is that of amphibian zoopomorphism.&nbsp; While western tales of human to amphibian transformation are most readily imagined through the Grimms&rsquo;s story, as I learned while in Bogot&aacute;, this form of metamorphosis is present elsewhere.&nbsp; People living in the Magdalena River Valley of central Colombia circa 1400, for example, believed that amphibians and reptiles &ldquo;were animals associated with passing from life on earth to the land of the dead.&rdquo;<a href=""#_edn17"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[xvii]</a>&nbsp; By thinking through these alternative cosmologies referenced in the <em>Princess and the Frog,</em> we might gain a greater understanding of both the actual as well as the symbolic violence being perpetrated upon the human and nonhuman communities in the vicinity of Arlington Marsh.&nbsp; The dredging of the marsh required to expand the New York Container Terminal facilities, will increase the risk of Katrina-like toxic flooding, taking these communities not only one step closer to Death&rsquo;s door, but bringing Death right under their doors as well<a href=""#_edn18"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[xviii]</a>.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, what might be gained from cohabitating with frogs in a flood mitigating, potentially vibrant coastal wetlands ecosystem like Arlington Marsh?&nbsp; The benefits for everyone, human and nonhuman, could be quite substantial.&nbsp; Some estimates suggest that wetlands store 300 to 700 billion tons of carbon globally, more than any other ecosystem, and an amount equal to or greater than what is in the atmosphere today<a href=""#_edn19"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[xix]</a>.&nbsp; By performatively cohabitating in wetlands with frogs through amphibious living, we might greatly reduce our collective carbon footprint and stem the rising tides.&nbsp; But sharing wetland habitats with our amphibian cousins, instead of burying them, can have other benefits, too.&nbsp; Wetlands are excellent ecosystems in which to forage for wild foods.&nbsp; In fact, if properly restored and respected, Arlington Marsh could act as a wonderful outdoor &ldquo;free food co-op&rdquo; and environmental education center for a North Shore community with few grocery stores.&nbsp; And as mosquito season approaches next June, wouldn&rsquo;t you love to have a frog as a roommate?&nbsp; As I learned from Natalie Jeremijenko, a professor of Art, Computer Science and Environmental Studies at NYU, West Nile Virus emerged out of New York City&rsquo;s degraded watershed because there were no amphibians to control the pathogenic breeding of mosquitoes.&nbsp; Knowing this, wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to have a little green friend sitting on your shoulder?&nbsp; Together, you and your roommate might perform a reparative intersubjectivity, by constituting each other as actively sharing bodies in the water.</p>
<p>
	Yet, when decisions have to be made, you need not feel compelled to share you entire life with a roommate who may be a little too slimy for your liking.&nbsp; The only question you need to answer is:&nbsp; Which green calls out to you?&nbsp; The green of capital, or the green of the frog?&nbsp; When you look into your future, which green do you see?&nbsp; Which green do you really need?</p>

	The New Everyday is a Media Commons project designed to be a reflection space on how everyday life has (and has not) been transformed since the theorizing of the 1980s by Stuart Hall and Michel de Certeau. It&#39;s purpose is to serve as a space of public reflection before (or instead of) the print/refereed publication.</p>
<p>
	Hall&#39;s impulse to this project was what he called &quot;The Great Moving Right Show,&quot; or more academically put, Thatcherism&#39;s hegemonic project. It&#39;s easily forgotten now but the analysis of Thatcherism was widely derided at the time, with people on the left insisting that this was simply old fashioned class politics in a slightly dressed up format; that Thatcher was stupid and by extension people were being stupid to vote for her.</p>
<p>
	Is this starting to sound familiar yet?</p>
<p>
	I wonder what you think of the Tea Party and the 2010 election-- it&#39;s been all about them. Let&#39;s consider the phenomenon. Is this a media manufactured movement? One paid for entirely by a small group of rich propagandists like the Koch brothers? Or is this another Moving Right Show, another hegemonic project? How might critical engagements begin to do this work of making distinctions?</p>
<p>
	Rather than wait for the usual academic process, I&#39;m hoping we might start a discussion immediately. This cluster will discuss what has happened, how we might respond, where we go next.</p>
<p>
	The results are in but there is no consensus as to what happened. Some see this as the start of a New Right; others as a passing distraction; others still as a convenient figleaf for corporate America.</p>
<p>
	Whatever the political conclusions, the media context has clearly changed. Whereas in 2008, the internet benefitted the Obama campaign, it&#39;s been Sarah Palin that has ruled Twitter in 2010. With the Glenn Beck/Fox News/Rush Limbaugh trifecta, old and new media have worked well for the Tea Party.</p>

	<strong>Distraction Span: Technologies of engagement and opportunities for productive disruption</strong></p>
<p>
	With this cluster of The New Everyday we initiate a conversation about social media that sidesteps the panic over youth and digital distraction while not being afraid to look head-on at their everyday engagements with mobile devices and social networking. We look to and include actual media practices to dispel the common diagnosis that networked media is rewiring young minds, displacing valuable forms of engagement, and making sustained reflection a thing of the past. Our aim is to challenge pathologizing discourses that frame young users of social media as simultaneously victims and threat (the teen who doesn&#39;t listen, who won&#39;t concentrate, who will fail to learn).</p>
<p>
	At the same time, we want to acknowledge that adults and youth can work together to make better sense and use of the interruptions, disturbances, and amusements introduced by new media. For instance, multitasking, fragmented and interlaced communication fostered by the culture of new media are undeniably novel and often challenging, especially in the classroom. Unlike television, digital media are integrated into work, school, and everyday life in ways that make them much harder for all people, and especially kids, to turn off or limit. Mobile media have also become requisite tools of productivity and social inclusion. Thus, the &quot;danger&quot; of distraction today isn&#39;t the lure of passivity, but relentless opportunities and demands for interaction even in the places where focus and introspection might be most useful.</p>
<p>
	There is also something old about the panic over new forms of media, the perceived detriment they pose to learning and thinking, and the use of young people as the heralds for and focus of this alarm. As the uses of mobile devices and platforms like texting, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube have grown to occupy significant amounts of time, it has become a challenge to grasp the diverse types of activities and conversations they actually hold and the types of connections they foster (as well as those they might displace or disrupt). One thing is certain though, schools and institutions of higher education have always faced a challenge in attempting to narrow and discipline students&rsquo; attention. And it&#39;s fair to say that learning is as much a result of resistance to discipline as it is the acceptance of a disciplining of focus. Successful education engages attention at points and encourages it to roam broadly at others. How does technology figure into this equation: what ways can it help us corral and disperse attention, and how does it hinder our efforts? And, how do we manage the clash between the distractions of continuous interleaved modes of communication and adults&rsquo; expectations about localized attention and social engagement?</p>
<p>
	Our best guess is that no simple correction or application (app) will come to light or be invented, rather people adapt multiple mechanisms of coping and achieving, and these emerge from everyday engagement with social media. In order to be able to identify and share these, we need more discussion about the differences in the ways people have taken to living and teaching within persistent and ubiquitous media environments. We need to share best case scenarios and worst. The contributors to this cluster describe their attempts to grapple with and adjust to the landscape of newly distributed attention.</p>
<p>
	We hope that this cluster will provoke both sustained reflection as well as disjointed rapid-fire thought on the topic. The discussion begins with our contributors who offer views on how diverse forms of sociality via networked media interface with the space of learning institutions. Elizabeth Losh reflects on a twitter experiment in an undergraduate course; Sara Harris considers uses of social media in journalism programs for underserved Los Angeles high school students; Lauren Berliner talks about the need to revamp media pedagogy to make it significant to a generation of vbloggers; Gina Lamb talks about mobile phones as &quot;home base&quot; for homeless LGBTQ youth; Asher Danziger advocates uses of digital media that creatively reclaim reflective thought, and Quinn Adney takes a leap off Facebook. Our contributors divert our attention to sites where the tension between focus and distraction is at play and consider both pedagogic strategies and community media projects that collaborate with and motivate youth to creatively and productively engage new media.</p>
<p>
	If multitasking is here to stay, if we are increasingly in many places at once, how can we as members of learning communities best be here and there simultaneously? We hope to use this cluster to begin an open conversation for educators and youth contributors to share what they have made and what they use, how they think about the media that surround them, and strategies they have developed to be productively distracted.</p>

	I am interested in the assumption that digital media deeply divide students and teachers and that a once covert war between &ldquo;us&rdquo; and &ldquo;them&rdquo; has turned into an open battle between &ldquo;our&rdquo; technologies and &ldquo;their&rdquo; technologies. On one side &ldquo;we&rdquo; the faculty control course management systems, online quizzes, wireless clickers, Internet access to PowerPoint slides and podcasts, and plagiarism detection software. &nbsp;On the student side &ldquo;they&rdquo; are armed with smart phones, laptops, music players, digital cameras, and social network sites. Young people are understood as the masters of ubiquitous computing and recording technologies, advanced weapons that allow both escape to virtual or social realities far away from the lecture hall or exposure of that lecture hall to the outside world, should they choose to document and broadcast the foibles of their faculty. Like the &quot;predator panic&quot; or the &quot;cyberbulling panic&quot; of recent years, the &quot;distraction panic&quot; posits that there is an unbridgeable generational divide that creates a potentially disastrous rupture in the fabric of society and the norms of the classroom.&nbsp; In my own teaching, I&#39;m interested in bridging divides, but not every pedagogical experiment I conduct is a successful one, particularly in the first iteration of a new lecture class of 200+ students that I&#39;ve scaled up from what was once a small senior seminar. &nbsp;&nbsp;If Dunbar&#39;s Number supposedly represents the upper limit of a functional community size that is defined by its social networks, the typical required course in public universities is also far over that number, and students&#39; desires to rebel against factory-scale teaching are definitely understandable. Type the words &ldquo;angry professor&rdquo; into a search engine and be prepared for videos of professors destroying digital devices or chiding their students for inattention.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the many remixes, parodies, and hoaxes generated around these &ldquo;angry professor&rdquo; videos demonstrates, trying to police student distraction in this way often only seems to &ldquo;feed the trolls.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	On January 27, 2011, I encouraged students in a large lecture hall class to write posts tagged with the course number on Twitter to facilitate an environment of lively exchange about course content.&nbsp; Relatively few posts in the Twitter backchannel were relevant to critical thinking about subject matter, and within minutes students used the mobile technology to coordinate an episode of mass coughing that seemed to express utter contempt for the specific material being taught about YouTube and disability to mark the campus&rsquo;s &ldquo;diversity day.&rdquo;&nbsp; It took weeks of intervention aimed at deconstructing the anonymity of the lecture hall to recover even the original level of trust on both sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	My experiment with Twitter was a &quot;teaching failure&quot; on a number of counts &lt;my essay&gt;, but I might argue that the &quot;productive distraction&quot; it generated certainly turned out to be a useful case study for many of the participants in the experiment. &nbsp;Most obviously, in a course where I took care to provide models and step-by-step instruction so that students could confidently produce work in new online genres, I made a critical mistake in not modeling and providing feedback about how to deploy microblogging text in a class setting, as teaching assistant Tara Zepel points out in her essay &lt;Tara&#39;s essay&gt;. &nbsp;Although I recently led an online workshop about <a href=""http://usccollege.na4.acrobat.com/p94309908/"">Writing as an Information Ar</a>t with accomplished Twitter pedagogue David Parry, I probably didn&#39;t do enough to orient my students to navigating the rapidly shifting information flows of Twitter in ways that might feel intellectually meaningful to them. &nbsp;From the students&#39; perspective, a number of them saw their subversive use of the technology as an act of political power, analogous to the smart mobs in the Middle East and North Africa using cell phones, text messages, and social networks to destabilize authoritarian regimes.&nbsp; <a href=""http://excelsior.ucsd.edu/siorgs/cat125/?p=2694"">One student blog post</a> argued that the &ldquo;humorous/disruptive scene&rdquo; that resulted from the Twitter experiment is &ldquo;not something to be belittled.&rdquo;<a href=""http://excelsior.ucsd.edu/siorgs/cat125/?p=3303"">Another blog entry</a> described the instigator of the coughing as &ldquo;one clever student&rdquo; who led the others to &ldquo;feel quite proud of ourselves.&quot;&nbsp; The &ldquo;clever student&rdquo; who led the in-class revolt has actually produced <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUK--TDCOpo"">a video esay for TNE</a>, which explores the analogy further and argues that the Twitter exercise made power structures in the lecture hall more visible to the students who spontaneously organized.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	However, in thinking about on-campus anxieties about technologies and learning, not all students imagine institutional takeover as their goal.&nbsp; But even in documenting how students feel incapacitated by the status quo, they observe how digital technologies shape their relationships to teaching and with faculty.&nbsp; For example, one of my students engaged in a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1U_I3YkQqE  "">structural critique of the way multitasking and distraction are engineered into student study</a> practice by curricular designers themselves now that higher education is structured around an infinite number of digital supplements. &nbsp;As a way to think about issues of digital inclusion and exclusion, I&#39;ve also included <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh5K6K7NGYA"">another video essay</a> from a student in the class who champions the leveling effect of short-form mobile communication as a way to build bridges between students and faculty.&nbsp; Rather than produce simple &ldquo;pro&rdquo; or &ldquo;con&rdquo; pieces that take sides in the debate over the consequences of student &ldquo;distraction,&rdquo; these three students focus on questioning institutional conventions about who controls discourse in the lecture hall, who gets to decide what is essential and what is supplemental, and who gets to talk to whom and how informally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Certainly the Twitter experiment helped students understand that digital tools could be used politically on campuses, but those undergraduates still needed theoretical tools and practical guidelines for more meaningful ethical, rhetorical, and historical reflection, once that aspect of unequal power relations was revealed.&nbsp; Too much of that process probably happened after the fact for students, but this project in TNE is part of my attempt to foster more conversation about how faculty should participate &ndash; and sometimes not participate &ndash; in the digital backchannels of their courses. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Some colleagues have been horrified by my detachment in studying this scene of pedagogical trauma so clinically or by my seemingly cavalier willingness to expose an intensely personal moment of lecture hall humiliation to public view, but I think all faculty need to look at edge cases like this one in order to figure out what good teaching and learning should be in the digital era.&nbsp; In other words, we need to get beyond propping up petty dictatorships that are obsessed with banning laptops or cellphones just as much as we need to get beyond romanticizing revolutionary clich&eacute;s about the wonders of the &ldquo;digital generation.&rdquo;&nbsp; After all, messier issues about everyday emotional engagement and alienation in the mixed reality of the lecture hall are too often ignored by assessment-oriented distance learning advocates who want to treat education as a mechanical and measurable process entirely lacking in affect.&nbsp; The fact that it is still possible to have scenes like this in which both faculty and students can experience strong feelings of betrayal and mistrust is something that should be examined.</p>

	As a teaching assistant for an upper-division writing class taught by Elizabeth Losh in the winter of 2011 at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), I was part of the Twitter experiment turned Twitter exploit.<a href=""#_edn1"" name=""_ednref"" title=""""></a>&nbsp; On a standard day, the class took the inevitable form of many large classes with a two-hundred plus student enrollment &ndash; a lecture.&nbsp; Over the course of the quarter, these lectures followed the broad theme of the course&rsquo;s title, &lsquo;CAT 125: Public Rhetoric and Practical Communication Online.&rsquo;&nbsp; Seeing an opportunity for a greater degree of student participation using the very social media technologies we had been critically discussing, Professor Losh invited a pedagogical experiment.</p>
<p>
	For thirty minutes of class one Thursday, students would be encouraged to use Twitter to generate a more organic and student-directed discussion than is customary in a large lecture setting.&nbsp; On the scheduled day, Professor Losh opened the specified #cat125 feed, reminded students of the invitation to tweet and switched to her lecture slides as she began her lecture on the topic of disability and social media.&nbsp; Thirty minutes later, with the majority of tweets pertaining to content unrelated to the lecture, the experiment ended with a tweet induced collective coughing fit.&nbsp; Immediately following, Professor Losh introduced a guest speaker in honor of Diversity Day on campus.&nbsp; Professor Tom Humphries, Associate Director of the Education Studies at UCSD and an established scholar on language and culture among Deaf people, took the stage.</p>
<p>
	Given an outcome that diverged from the anticipated use of social media to engender class-related discussion, the question that immediately surfaced was did the experiment fail? The events and conversations that unfolded surrounding this pedagogical experiment actually address two interrelated but separate issues: 1) the effectiveness of a twitter-enabled backchannel in a university lecture hall and 2) the affective alignment of this backchannel with content.&nbsp; My focus in this commentary is primarily on the first and although the pedagogical value of the experiment was not that which might have been intended, something was learned in relation to each of these issues.&nbsp; The experiment did not fail.&nbsp; My response is not one characterized by a fear of technological dystopia or distraction.&nbsp; Equally, it is not one that embraces techno-futurist utopianism.&nbsp; It is above all a response that concerns the important role context has to play when incorporating networked social media into established pedagogical structures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>What Exactly Happened?</strong></p>
<p>
	In the weeks leading up to the set date, Professor Losh introduced Twitter and how to tweet to a lecture hall where everybody had heard of the micro-blogging platform, but only half knew how it functioned and even fewer had an account.&nbsp; Admittedly, even as a graduate student who specializes in a new media field, I fell into the group of non-account holders but I was excited at the prospect of the experiment.&nbsp; So, I created an account and prepared to join in on the conversation.&nbsp; On the day of the experiment, we hoped that the Twitter backchannel would allow for multi-way dialogue and/or commentary about the lecture material among those seated in the lecture hall.&nbsp; This was not the reality.</p>
<p>
	Once the experiment started, a handful of isolated tweets did address the topic of the lecture.&nbsp; After watching a YouTube video created by a young woman with autism<a href=""#_edn2"" name=""_ednref"" title=""""></a>, one student wrote, &ldquo;#cat125 I have always kind of wondered what it might feel like to live inside an autistic mind, at least now I have seen it&hellip;.in some form.&rdquo;&nbsp; Others expressed discomfort with the material.&nbsp; However, most of the dialogue that occurred, that is the tweets that responded to and referenced each other, concerned topics that had no relation to the lecture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	One such conversation topic involved the prospect of trending in San Diego.&nbsp; A student tweeted, &ldquo;i wonder if we could actually get #cat125 to become a top trending topic. that would be ridiculously fun.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which another responded, &ldquo;clearly we aren&rsquo;t tweeting enough if we aren&rsquo;t even a top trending topic.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, @TrendsSanDiego confirmed that the tweet frequency had tipped: &ldquo;#cat125 is now trending in #SanDiego <a href=""http://trendsmap.com/us/san+diego"">http://trendsmap.com/us/san+diego</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The other topic of choice was the plan of a coughing uprising.&nbsp; One student, who appeared to have conversed with another over a non-Twitter channel proposed, &ldquo;#cat125 i say at 2:30 we all randomly start coughing . . . the proff isn&rsquo;t tweeting so she won&rsquo;t know whts going on hahaha.&rdquo;<a href=""#_edn3"" name=""_ednref"" title=""""></a>&nbsp; The suggestion prompted other tweets such as, &ldquo;lezz doo itt! #cat125&rdquo; and &ldquo;#cat125 2min left guys!&nbsp; The countdownnnnnnn haha.&rdquo;&nbsp; At 2:30 the coughing began which prompted me to check the twitter feed to confirm what I suspected, that this collective action began with a tweet.&nbsp; This was the official end to the experiment.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Is Twitter an Effective Backchannel?</strong></p>
<p>
	During our regularly scheduled and far more intimate section meeting later that day, I asked a group of fifteen students what they thought of the experience, both critically and viscerally.&nbsp; Did it succeed or fail?&nbsp; A desired outcome of the experiment was to destabilize the traditional lecture dynamic.&nbsp; Using Twitter, students could have a collective voice and engage with and discuss the material on their own terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Yet, first words out of many of my students&rsquo; mouths were, &ldquo;She [the professor] didn&rsquo;t tell us what to do.&rdquo;&nbsp; The students wanted a defined and transparent assignment, ideally, or instructed suggestions, at the least.&nbsp; When I responded that the purpose of the experiment was precisely to break these constraints and pushed the students to further develop their opinions, the conversation quickly veered into the realm of traditional pedagogical expectations and norms.&nbsp; All but two of the fifteen students voiced that they expected some level of direction, especially in a lecture setting.&nbsp; Some even felt that such direct guidance was a necessary element of education.</p>
<p>
	The other point that my students brought up in our post-experiment discussion was one of distraction.&nbsp; The majority stressed that because they had to divide their attention between the twitter screen feed on their phones or laptops and the lecture material on the projection screen, they could not effectively pay attention to either.&nbsp; I confess I also felt the pull of multi-tasking between two separate screens.&nbsp; While this perceived tension may allude to a valid criticism of new technology and suggest the need for a degree of coherence when using networked media for pedagogical purposes, it is also a bit perplexing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Without exception, in the CAT 125 lecture hall and in every other classroom I have sat in since laptops and cell phones became regular attendees of university classes, students routinely have some communication or entertainment technology running in the background.&nbsp; The usual suspects are e-mail, Facebook, SMS, and computer games.&nbsp; Yet, the majority of them are also using their networked devices to reference the course website, look up a word or an event, and type notes as the professor talks.&nbsp; Before laptops and cell phones, it was passing notes and doodling.&nbsp; Put simply, students are good at multi-tasking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The twitter experiment, then, should have appealed to their incredible multi-tasking abilities. Since Twitter&rsquo;s launch in 2006, several instructors have incorporated twitter in the classroom, many with similar intentions of bolstering student participation in a lecture setting.&nbsp; Monica A. Rankin, an assistant professor of history at the University of Texas at Dallas, used twitter as a backchannel in a class of ninety students.&nbsp; Sugato Chakravarty, a professor of consumer sciences and retailing at Purdue, encourages his lecture hall of 250 students to do the same.<a href=""#_edn4"" name=""_ednref"" title=""""></a>&nbsp; Others, such as Dave Parry, an assistant professor of Emerging Media and Communications, also at the University of Texas at Dallas, have employed Twitter in smaller class sizes with success.<a href=""#_edn5"" name=""_ednref"" title=""""></a>&nbsp; So why, in this case, did the students collectively use Twitter for other purposes?</p>
<p>
	What ties each of these other examples together is the use of the platform on a regularly scheduled basis.&nbsp; Professors Ranking, Chakravarty and Parry all foreground Twitter as a standard component of the classroom experience and address the commentary stream during the class period.&nbsp; What we asked students to do was to experiment with Twitter on a single occasion, without any facilitation and without the presence of an authority figure.&nbsp; One might think that in a class focused on the rhetorical use of online communication, students would apply the critical analysis and use of online media modeled in lecture to their participation in the experiment.&nbsp; However, based on the two main points raised by my students, this was merely an assumption.&nbsp; It seems that as a group, the students chose to partially shed their identity as students in a classroom precisely because the request did not fit within their expectations of the roles and responsibilities teachers and students should have in a university context, in general, and a lecture class, in particular.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Is Twitter an Affective Backchannel? </strong></p>
<p>
	The key concept to take from this discussion is one of context.&nbsp; Interestingly, context is also at the center of the second issue that informs the question of the experiment&rsquo;s success.&nbsp; After the experiment officially ended, and having kept to her policy of nonintervention, Professor Losh joined the stream and asked, &ldquo;@_@ why is everyone coughing #cat125?&rdquo; to which a student replied, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what to say&hellip;#cat125 deleting account now&hellip;&rdquo;<a href=""#_edn6"" name=""_ednref"" title=""""></a></p>
<p>
	It is important here to recall that the focus of the day&rsquo;s lecture was the intersection of disability and technology.&nbsp; There is something unsettling about the perceived insensitivity of using a Twitter backchannel to organize a coughing coup given the topic being discussed at the front of the lecture hall.&nbsp; Whether the student who deleted her account in reaction to the coughing did so in relation to a disrespect for the professor, or for the subject-matter, or both is unclear.&nbsp; I can say that while my students were quick to defend their use of Twitter for non-educational ends, they were horrified when I suggested the potential way their collective actions could be interpreted.&nbsp; Of course, only about a third of the students in the lecture that day actually participated in the Twitter stream, but even in terms of initial reactions to the experiment, the students simply did not take the disconnect with the lecture content into account.&nbsp; It simply didn&rsquo;t register.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The fear that digital media is making us more insensitive or allowing us to live in our own self-defined reality is not what I have chosen to address here. What I can say, on the basis of exploring one particular use of Twitter in the classroom is that new networked and social media technologies offer a tremendous potential for disrupting an educational structure that often unintentially promotes passive engagement and single-direction learning.&nbsp; However, specifying and paying attention to the context in which these tools are used is a necessary step for working out the glitches from this opportunity.&nbsp; The fact that the students used Twitter in a way that, for the most part, was not related to the class and was seemingly disrespectful does not mean that the experiment failed.&nbsp; What it does mean is that as technology continues to enter the culture of pedagogy, we must take seriously where these glitches reveal we are butting up against existing walls and continue to experiment, tweak, and break these down from the inside out.</p>

	At two o&rsquo;clock on January 27, 2011, the experiment began.&nbsp; In an effort to get more of the two hundred plus enrolled students in my large lecture class participating in class discussion, I chose a hashtag on Twitter, #cat125, and invited a roomful of otherwise silent and passive UC San Diego seniors in the Culture, Art, and Technology program to tweet for thirty minutes and thus add their comments to a freeform evolving stream of text in the public record.&nbsp; Two weeks earlier, I had posted the first message: &ldquo;Soon the experiment begins #cat125.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In the days leading up to the experiment, I cheerfully projected the #cat125 Twitter feed in class and walked the undergraduate audience through Twitter&rsquo;s basic lexicon of URL-shorteners, hashtags, and &ldquo;@&rdquo; call signs.&nbsp; Fellow academics who had followed my fitfully energetic tweeting at conferences or professional conventions hailed the effort after my post, &ldquo;I am showing my #cat125 class how to use Twitter now,&rdquo; appeared on their news feeds for the service. &nbsp;Nina Huntemann, an editor of a collection that had included my work, sent &ldquo;a hello wave from Boston.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open publishing advocate Kathleen Fitzpatrick chimed in too: &nbsp;&ldquo;Hi, #cat125!&rdquo;&nbsp; Cheryl Ball at Illinois State observed that she would soon be doing the same with her &ldquo;multimodal seminar students.&rdquo;&nbsp; Katherine Harris at San Jose State posted an exuberant &ldquo;Well, hello everyone! We&#39;re listening; jump into the conversation at any time #cat125.&rdquo;&nbsp; Meanwhile students were tentatively testing the waters with first messages like this one: &ldquo;@lizlosh this is my first time user twitter, and my first tweet ever. Hello #cat125.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Of course, despite these auspicious beginnings, I knew that pedagogical disaster was a distinct possibility.&nbsp; Social media maven danah boyd has described her own Twitter debacle that took place during a talk in November of 2009 in which &ldquo;outbursts and laughter&rdquo; revealed that Twitter &ldquo;had become the center of attention, not the speaker.&rdquo;<a href=""#_edn1"" name=""_ednref"" title=""""></a>&nbsp; One of boyd&rsquo;s online catcallers reflected later about his culpability in the event:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 1in;"">
	It seems that the more subtle the speaker&rsquo;s point, the more impatient and nasty the audience became . . . The wall made a spectacle of the crowd&rsquo;s impatience and anxiety feeding on the speaker&rsquo;s inability to respond. That spectacle united us not as a single group receiving challenging ideas from a thoughtful orator but as quite separate individuals struggling to listen, read, respond, and make sense of the event.<a href=""#_edn2"" name=""_ednref"" title=""""></a></p>
<p>
	A few weeks after my own Twitter experiment seemed to fail I read a similarly remorseful account from journalist Nir Rosen. He had resigned from his fellowship at NYU in humiliation after tweeting sadistically about the assault of an Egyptian crowd upon CBS reporter Lara Logan.&nbsp; In &ldquo;How 480 Characters Unraveled My Career,&rdquo; Rosen reiterates his apology, denies any misogyny on his own part, and expresses contempt for the &ldquo;bizarre, voyeuristic Internet culture&rdquo; in which &ldquo;everybody in the mob is looking to get in on the next fight first, to be at the center of the <em>thing</em> that&#39;s happening, even if there&#39;s nothing really there.&rdquo;<a href=""#_edn3"" name=""_ednref"" title=""""></a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly, as students chose screen names, there were already signs that they wanted to remain anonymous and ironically distant from the proceedings: their online monikers included &ldquo;cat125isthebest,&rdquo; &ldquo;IHeartCat125,&rdquo; &ldquo;CATmademetweet,&rdquo; and &ldquo;ChancellorFox&rdquo; after the head of the university.&nbsp; However, because witty, short-form communication that is heavy on humor and light on gravitas is the preferred vernacular, I lauded rather than chastised them for their inventiveness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Soon after the experiment commenced, multitasking and divided attention quickly became major themes in the Twitter stream.&nbsp; One student admitted &ldquo;I feel guilty to have made this twitter account during class . . . but I blame new media for my A.D.D.&rdquo;&nbsp; Others focused on their sensory perceptions of stimuli unrelated to the lecture with comments like &ldquo;I just noticed all the flags on the ceiling&rdquo; or &ldquo;Who is eating tasty delicious smelling food?&nbsp; What delicious vittles are you enjoying?&rdquo;&nbsp; During a class session devoted to disability videos on YouTube, even comments somewhat germane to the clips that were shown emphasized the students&rsquo; difficulties with sustained attention and engagement, particularly if the video timeline played for more than a few minutes.&nbsp; Some credited their discomfort with the material as a reason to tune out.&nbsp; As one student opined while a video created by an autistic person played, &ldquo;i feel alienated when I was watching that video earlier today.&nbsp; I had to stop it in the middle.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Many of these students were paying much more attention to the popularity metrics that drive social media platforms like Twitter than to the course&rsquo;s content.&nbsp; One wrote, &ldquo;I wonder if we could actually get #cat125 to become a top trending topic.&nbsp; that would be ridiculously fun.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another student bemoaned the fact that &ldquo;clearly we aren&rsquo;t tweeting enough if we aren&rsquo;t even a top trending topic.&rdquo;&nbsp; Soon notices informed them that they had reached their collective goal and that #cat125 was trending in San Diego.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Within minutes the students also made plans for coordinated counter-programming to my carefully orchestrated series of presentations about disability on YouTube in honor of Diversity Day on the campus.&nbsp; First, there was the suggestion to all drop pencils at a given time.&nbsp; Then, a particularly confident user of Twitter and other forms of social media gave a command that was retweeted throughout the room: &ldquo;i say at 2:30 we all randomly start coughing . . . the proff isn&rsquo;t tweeting so she won&rsquo;t know whts going on hahaha.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had, in fact, seen the pencil drop tweet and was aware that there was dissatisfaction with both the class and the experiment being expressed in the room, but I had set a rule for nonintervention and was preoccupied with the special guest who had just arrived in the lecture hall, Professor Tom Humphries, Associate Director of the Education Studies program on my campus and co-author of the influential books <em>Deaf in America: Voices from a Culture</em> (1988) and <em>Inside Deaf Culture</em> (2005).</p>
<p>
	Right on schedule at 2:30 the coughing began in the middle of a video created by a schizophrenic female journalist. Tweets such as &ldquo;hahahah at the coughing,&rdquo; &ldquo;hehe,&rdquo; and &ldquo;halls anyone?&rdquo; soon appeared with the #cat125 hashtag.&nbsp; One student suggested that &ldquo;We should &lsquo;applaud&rsquo; in American Sign Language instead,&rdquo; and another posted &ldquo;Say when,&rdquo; but the coughing and laughing continued until I announced the end of the use of laptops and other mobile devices and introduced the Professor Humphries to the group.&nbsp; Among the final words registered in the stream as students were closing laptops and cellphones was the student who wrote this plaintive farewell: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what to say . . . #cat125 deleting account now&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp; In expressing both her disapproval of the conduct of her classmates and her own form of ironic distance on the experiment, another wrote, &ldquo;I remember that from eighth grade.&nbsp; #cat125.&nbsp; This is why we can&rsquo;t have nice things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	When I have told the story of the Twitter experiment and the coughing exploit that followed to my academic colleagues, I hear a lot of generalizations to explain the students&rsquo; seemingly callous behavior in front of both a guest (and his translator and his translator&rsquo;s class of student-interpreters) and a deaf peer seated in the front row on a day designated for tolerance and understanding for the entire campus.&nbsp; Faculty claim that such antics are symptomatic of a broader undermining of respect for knowledge among the so-called &ldquo;digital generation&rdquo; and a waning of the traditions of sustained attention once fostered by print culture.&nbsp; Others credit the taunting to the numbing effect of communication at a distance without the social glue of face-to-face communication.&nbsp; Some even suggest, in a live-by-the-sword/die-by-the-sword logic, all classes in and about the Internet will necessarily devolve in this way, so academic departments should think carefully before placing them on their schedules.</p>
<p>
	In contrast, many students saw revolution rather than devolution at work in recalling the events of the day and understood it as a manifestation of the power of self-organizing groups with distributed communication tools. &nbsp;&nbsp;On the class blog a number of students made analogies between the coughing exploit orchestrated with Twitter and the activities of flash mobs using mobile devices to topple the regime in Egypt at about the same time.</p>
<p>
	I&rsquo;m not sure I accept the easy analogy between radically different political and cultural contexts or the rhetoric of petty dictatorships, but I did get a number of very substantive suggestions from students drawing on examples that range from a Facebook course page<a href=""#_edn4"" name=""_ednref"" title=""""></a> to an episode of <em>Gray&rsquo;s Anatomy<a href=""#_edn5"" name=""_ednref"" title=""""></a></em> for ways that social media could have been used more effectively in my classroom.&nbsp; Expressed in these postings is a desire for students&rsquo; common digital efforts to be directed toward specific and measurable learning goals rather than to the flash mob behavior celebrated by others.&nbsp; Not all of these suggestions include an active role for the lead instructor.&nbsp; So I&rsquo;ve invited both undergraduate students and graduate teaching assistants to record their own impressions of the Twitter experiment and to add their own analysis to my account. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	As a person who was raised alongside digital technology, I think it is valid to question the quantity and quality of the vast intake of information in this digital age.&nbsp; To make relevant old ideas such as meditation and immersive thinking one must harness them within the rhythms of the current social moment and its media. By structuring a new form based on and existing within the confines of the larger networked media, I hope to engage in conversation about the possibilities for depth within a medium that is often regarded as shallow.</p>

	Facebook asks us to share and store our living memory in a virtual plane, so what I find myself wondering is, &quot;what happens to those memories if they are not recorded as everyone else&#39;s?&quot; &nbsp;To discover the answer to this question, I&#39;ve decided to take myself completely out of the equation and remove myself from Facebook. Five years of my life has been put on pause and temporarily erased.&nbsp;What lead me to take this leap was the feeling that Facebook is a distraction from life, taking from the physical world and giving to the virtual. This shift in power was never experienced by prior generations, so we are faced with the unprecedented challenge of incorporating the social networking site into daily life while not allowing it to take over.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	I figured my life would change, but I didn&#39;t realize the full extent until months down the road.&nbsp; <img src=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/dsc_4386.preview.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	I have looked into the eyes of multiple dates as I told them I have deactivated my Facebook account for an indefinite amount of time and observed the initial fear that follows my statement. &nbsp;New media and my generation can be likened to a parasite and its host. &nbsp;We are unable to survive without the other and yearn for greater technology and more fans or followers. Facebook has integrated itself into college life at even the most minuscule levels. Invitations to events and parties have almost completely moved to the digital realm. Word of mouth has become limited as students assume anyone who should attend an event already knows about it and has plans on attending. &nbsp;Why talk about something that doesn&rsquo;t need to be mentioned? &nbsp;Time is precious to any college student and Facebook allows time to speed up considerably. &nbsp;Why go on three dates with a person before finding out that they have irreconcilable differences in music taste or that he has a secret boyfriend that he never mentions? &nbsp;Instead, today&rsquo;s youth &ldquo;Facebook stalk&rdquo; someone and discover general information about the person that might not be revealed until much time passes. &nbsp;But is the Facebook version of a person an adequate representation of the actual human being? &nbsp;If I wanted to go online and tell the world that my favorite band is The Beatles and that my favorite activity is hiking, there is no reason to doubt my submission unless you know me prior. &nbsp;But a concern about truthfulness is usually overlooked for the sake of time. &nbsp;We trust Facebook to do the regular work of getting to know someone in a way we never would in a bar or at a party.</p>
<p>
	When I first deactivated my account, I was met with several attempts by Facebook to get me to stay on board, showing me pictures of who the social networking site believed to be close enough to me to be able to guilt me into staying. &nbsp;What Facebook doesn&rsquo;t know about me is that when I want something, I will break my arm if that means achieving my goal. &nbsp;I was leaving and there was nothing they could do to stop me. &nbsp;My initial feeling was excitement and freedom. &nbsp;I had done it! &nbsp;The next couple days felt like a withdrawal I had only seen in movies. &nbsp;I was addicted to Facebook and without it I was lost. &nbsp;My days felt empty and my fingers kept instinctually moving to the &ldquo;F&rdquo; on my keyboard. &nbsp;These symptoms lessened and within three weeks, it was normal to me that I didn&rsquo;t have Facebook. &nbsp;As far as I was concerned, I was never going back.&nbsp; <img src=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/img_2380.preview.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	Life undeniably moves slower without Facebook, but I don&rsquo;t view that as a negative fact. There are times when I would like to &ldquo;Facebook stalk&rdquo; someone before risking my emotions, but I keep telling myself that my parents did fine and they didn&rsquo;t even have cell phones when they met. &nbsp;Maybe I was born in the wrong generation, but I think this is the way it was meant to be. &nbsp;Life isn&rsquo;t meant to be easily controlled. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t pause, rewind, search or fast-forward life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;I first met the <em>Sexy Time in Dewey </em>vloggers in a weekly media workshop I designed as part of my dissertation research aimed to introduce San Diego LGBTQIA youth to video production as a means by which to critically engage with their own life experiences in the context of present and past media representations of Queer life. I arrived at the first session with a carload of equipment borrowed from local universities and a loose curriculum that, as flexible as it was, ultimately needed to be radically readjusted to make the workshop relevant to the young people who showed up to participate.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During our introductions I asked the participants if they had ever endeavored in any kind of media production. Tyler talked about appearing on-camera for his school&#39;s TV news program, Pacifica claimed not to have any experience, but when pressed, mentioned that she had made a slideshow for an English class assignment on <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, and Chris shyly suggested that she <em>may </em>have recorded videos of herself performing with her guitar. We were about an hour into the session when another youth from the group turned to them and asked, &quot;wait, don&#39;t you guys have a vlog?&quot; Chris responded, &quot;oh, yeah but that&#39;s something we just do when we hang out. It doesn&#39;t count.&quot; The group was convinced of this because they produce their video blog, <em>Sexy Time in Dewey</em> outside of any formal setting, at their own whim, using low-quality consumer technology (a still camera and Roxio software). While the group had never been explicitly discouraged from producing their blog, somewhere along the way they had received the message that spending time posting and commenting on YouTube is not part of the learning process and not only not worthwhile to mention in an educational setting, but something that might be construed by their instructors as a (perhaps embarrassing) waste of time.</p>
<p>
	<em>Sexy Time in Dewey </em>features seven high school seniors from a wealthy San Diego suburb, who, from within a Mitsubishi Montero (affectionately called &quot;Dewey&quot; for reasons none of the participants can recall or perhaps care to report), discuss the ways in which they are coming to understand and explore their sexual identities. In the spirit of a mobile &quot;coming out&quot; support group, the teens offer up their own experiences as guidance to other young viewers while demonstrating that it is possible to be open about one&#39;s sexuality and still find supportive friends.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vlog consists of episodes that are loosely organized around themes such as &quot;Resources,&quot; &quot;Labels,&quot; &quot;High School&quot; and &quot;Gay Straight Crushes.&quot; Chris Holmes, Dewey&#39;s owner and in all ways the driving force behind the series, typically initiates the conversation from the front seat while the still camera on her dashboard faces back at the others and records in a series of short clips. Someone in the car will ask a topical question like &quot;what&#39;s it like to be gay at school?&quot; and the others will earnestly work out their answers. Their analysis often comes through in their &ldquo;bloopers,&rdquo; amidst giggling and talking over each other. &quot;The only reason we are a minority is because there are so many people in the closet,&quot; Ashley concludes.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The teens occasionally fall out of the frame to lean on each other, conveying a familiarity and comfort with both themselves and the viewer&#39;s gaze that mitigates against the potential for the discussion to seem contrived or didactic. It&#39;s like getting a ride to your first day of school with a cool clique of upperclassmen who know the ropes and are excited to be the ones to help ease your transition. &quot;Ask us questions,&quot; they plea at the end of one episode. &quot;Give us ideas or comments! It&#39;s way too difficult to think of these things!&quot;</p>

<p>
	<em>Sexy Time in Dewey </em>is a timely contribution to the growing pool of online resources for struggling Queer youth in the recent wake of the highly publicized suicides of Billy Lucas, Tyler Clementi, and several others who had been bullied because they were perceived to be gay. Most notable has been the <em>It Gets Better</em> online video campaign (<a href=""http://www.itgetsbetter.com/"">www.itgetsbetter.com</a>) in which adults, many of whom are celebrities, give personal testimonies encouraging struggling youth to believe that their circumstances will eventually improve. First begun by syndicated columnist Dan Savage and his partner Terry Miller, the campaign now includes over 6,000 videos, including one by President Obama. While <em>It Gets Better</em> has been commended by many LGBTQIA advocates for helping to bring attention, inspiration, and resources to struggling teens, the project has also been critiqued for proliferating what Jasbin Puar has referred to as &quot;a mandate to fold into urban, neoliberal gay enclaves, a form of liberal handholding and upward-mobility that echoes the now discredited &#39;pull yourself up from the bootstraps&#39; immigrant motto.&quot; For these critics, <em>It Gets Better</em> suggests that teens should somehow <em>overcome</em> rather than confront the social and institutional structures that produce homophobia or take practical steps to improve one&#39;s circumstances and self-esteem (Doyle). As one <em>Sexy Time in Dewey </em>contributor put it, &quot;I&#39;m glad it gets better, but I don&#39;t want to have to wait until then. And in the meantime I don&#39;t want to have to want to kill myself for anyone to care.&quot; Hence their show.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The goal behind <em>Sexy Time in Dewey</em> has always been simple: &quot;speak to other gay kids.&quot; They are motivated by impulse rather than a pedagogical or political vision. They make episodes when it is convenient within their hangout schedule and if they are all in the car when someone happens to have a camera, they pick a topic and press record. There is no master plan, barely any effort to expand viewership beyond the 300-plus viewings per episode they already have, no agenda, and they have not sought out support or acknowledgement from their teachers or mentors at the community center.&nbsp;The <em>Sexy Time in Dewey </em>group came to my program already doing the kind of work I had hoped to begin with them. They are fulfilling the mission of the <em>It Gets Better</em> campaign to &quot;remind LGBT teens that they are not alone&quot; while also addressing many of its shortcomings. They are engaging in critical practices of self-examination, self-presentation and group dialogue and have taken on the self-assigned role of peer leaders without explicitly knowing or naming their practices as such. In their video discussions they work together to think through personal and community issues and take action by offering advice and concern to their peers. They form critical perspectives on controversial issues such as gay conversion therapy and offer advice and support to those who might be experiencing pressure to enter such a program.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, they are acquiring production skills through trial and error and developing their own style and structure informed by other shows they have seen. &nbsp;And their viewers are engaged in this learning process offering advice on technical skills such as how to obtain clearer audio when they record in the car.</p>
<p>
	Taking <em>Sexy Time in Dewey&#39;s </em>lead, I have shifted the goal of our workshop toward leveraging what the group and the other participants are <em>already</em> doing on their own. Rather than introducing new projects and instructing them how to use equipment that may not be relevant, we are learning how to use video recording and editing technologies and techniques that may enhance clarity and provide options if the group chooses to produce other kinds of media in the future. Together we are investigating how to increase viewership and enrich the dialogue that is already happening in the comments section while working towards understanding how their vlogging figures into the context of new media practice and the history of Queer advocacy and self-representation. Through my experience with the <em>Sexy Time in Dewey</em> vloggers I have come to recognize an imperative to shift media pedagogy toward recognizing distracted media practices as productive and to see their integration into curricula as an opportunity to guide youth toward using these tools to make critical and artistic interventions into everyday culture.</p>

In most public schools in Los Angeles, online access and new software and applications arrive in the classroom via corporate or philanthropic donations, if at all. In the public schools I have taught in, students have very limited opportunities to use computers as a group and in a context where a common goal guides the quest for digital expression and information-gathering. </span><br />

As such, the lab feels more like a bankrupt internet cafe -- a site of momentary access for condensed social or professional or gaming communication but no social networking-- than it does like a space for exploration and academic learning. Combine their usually brief school-based opportunities with the dearth of internet access on computers at homes and the proliferation of smart-phones (which are not ideal for academic research and writing) and for LAUSD students, you have a situation not unlike a hungry man invited to a full buffet who is told to use a saucer to serve himself instead of a dinner plate.

Ass instructors, we relied on and shared our own computers and portable recording devices with students. Still coming up short, we proposed students share their phones to do the work in class. This was an unorthodox request as cellphones are forbidden in the classroom. Prior to starting the class, we had conducted a survey of all students and found out that of our twenty high school students, seven used their smart-phone to access the web, ten had computers at home, and five didn&rsquo;t have access to the web at all. &nbsp;</span><br />

The act of sharing and pairing based on digital capacity allowed for productive group activities centered around a device normally associated with negative distraction in the classroom. From that point forward, students made their work using a combination of professional portable devices from teachers and off-the-shelf mobile phones owned by &nbsp;their peers. The fact that they were already inclined to share their phones and SMS photos and videos made the whole process of coordinating a large group with varying interests almost seamless. Creative distraction was something several of them used to and others craved. We provided the opportunity to use the classroom as a setting to work together to produce focused and meaningful media with otherwise forbidden or inaccessible tools.</span><br />

Thus, adding media to required course work seems to provide a fun distraction, but not a quality forum for learning or expression. For these tools to move beyond a distraction in this setting, students need a culture of creative focus using tools they normally associated with distraction. To return to Jesse Nerio, who puts it best: &nbsp;&ldquo;It has to really do with students in school and the way they act toward computers and the energy they bring to school. That can change a lot, but that has to do with the teachers.&rdquo;</span><br />

	I have spent much of the last ten years offering digital arts workshops for LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay Bi-sexual, Transgender, and Questioning) youth at <a href=""http://www.reach.la"">REACH LA</a>, a youth driven non-profit organization in downtown Los Angeles. Providing a space for youth to explore creative expression through digital technologies has been an immensely rewarding experience and has opened my eyes to the important role that digital technologies play in the lives of these young people. They seem to have an innate sense of the importance of creating their own histories and families since mainstream society has failed LGBTQ youth in providing positive role models and safe spaces to find themselves.&nbsp; Digital technologies and mobile devices provide opportunities for these youth to connect with one another, share stories, and create safe social spaces where being gay is not just okay...it&rsquo;s the way to be.&nbsp; Technology is not a distraction for these youth, it is a lifesaver in their coming of age process. Rather than keeping them from deeper experiences and understandings, phones and other mobile and social technologies provide the home they need from which to develop self and community.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The primary program area of REACH LA is to serve LGBTQ youth who are at high risk for HIV infection with prevention and testing services.&nbsp; This is a tough group to organize and keep tabs on, as most have unstable living situations including short-term rentals, couch hopping, or homelessness. Growing up gay or transgender in an unsupportive family home can subject youth to physical and verbal abuse and/or lead to them being kicked out of the home or running away. For these youth the stress of finding a safe place to live in Los Angeles has been exacerbated by the closing of GLASS (Gay and Lesbian Adolescent Social Services) in 2008, that provided the only group home for LGBT foster youth, and by recent budget cuts to social service and nonprofit providers that work with these populations. For most of these youth, pulling together first and last month rent plus deposit is an insurmountable obstacle to obtaining stable housing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Less financially daunting and considered <strong><em>the must have</em></strong> accessory for any youth today is the cell phone, sidekick, or smart phone.&nbsp; These devices essentially become &ldquo;home-base&rdquo; for at-risk youth and a means by which services providers can keep in touch with this hard to track population.&nbsp; I know many youth that can&rsquo;t afford to keep a roof over their head, but will pay for a smart phone since this &nbsp;is their way of staying connected to the world.&nbsp; Phones can be used to look for jobs, search for apartments, meet up with friends, and update their Facebook or Myspace status.&nbsp; For service providers, mobile access is essential for keeping in touch with these youth to make sure they get follow-up counseling, get to medical appointments, and just to check-in to see how a client is doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Many agencies including REACH LA use text messaging lists as the most inexpensive and effective way to reach this population for outreach events and service updates.&nbsp; &nbsp;REACH LA also uses mobile phone service as a way for youth clients to check whether HIV confidential testing is available at any given day/time.&nbsp; The phone serves as a very discreet and intimate means to get information about HIV prevention and/or testing status.&nbsp; The combination of mobile phones and Facebook has greatly improved nonprofits abilities to stay in touch with this highly mobile group of youth.&nbsp; For example, if a client loses their phone (a common occurrence) then Facebook serves as a back-up to re-establish contact with that youth until a new phone number is set up.&nbsp; In the past this may have meant losing touch with a client for months or even years, resulting in a perilous interruption of services.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Youth are doing amazing things from their phones. One homeless youth that we worked with, who is now residing in Atlanta, keeps us updated with his news and writings by blogging from his phone and serves as an inspiration for other youth.&nbsp; Another youth, responding to a dearth of housing for LGBT street youth in Los Angeles, organized a series of hostel style apartments in Hollywood where youth could pay for a week at a time to have a bunkbed space in a shared living arrangement (http://www.thehollywooddorms.com/).&nbsp; He used his sidekick phone to remotely arrange meetings, conduct interviews, check on the security system and even open and close the apartment doors for clients.&nbsp; This is a youth that came up through the foster system and did not attend high school.&nbsp; His tech and organizing savvy comes from years of promoting large safe party events for LGBT youth by using phone line recordings and mass text messaging connected to a Myspace page (http://myspace.com/prettyboyempire).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	LGBT youth need ways to meet other youth, to find information about LGBT services, social and cultural events&hellip;more so than do other youth. They need devices to connect them to the world, so they can understand that the feelings that they have today have been shared by many that have walked before them. Probably the most critical service that a mobile device can provide is a feeling of being connected when it is needed the most.&nbsp; When your situation is dire and you are sleeping alone in a park, or at the beach, or even in a hostile home environment, the phone can literally be lifesaver connecting LGBT youth to a suicide hotline, shelter, police, or just a comforting voice of a mentor or friend.</p>

14497,"contributed_pieces",2316,"After WikiLeaks, Us",1,1301929775,1303487644,2,NULL,14505,"<p>
	The 1918 Sears, Roebuck catalog features a spectacular ad for a device called the &ldquo;Home Motor.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a five pound electric motor you plug into &ldquo;city current,&rdquo; and it provides motive power through a series of peripherals you hook up to it: blades for a fan, paddles for a beater/mixer, a rotary arm for turning a mechanical sewing machine, and so on &mdash; even a compact vibrator, &ldquo;with three attachments.&rdquo; There is something obviously, gloriously absurd about this object now: a home only needs one motor! What happened, of course, was that small electric motors migrated into every appliance; each had their own. A single source of power in the home was the introductory step.</p>
<p>
	WikiLeaks, the organization, is a genuine 21st-century event. It has a core team of highly skilled programmers, working relationships with media outlets and a few trustworthy ISPs and political bodies, immense goodwill within the geek and hacker communities, and the assistance of groups like Anonymous. Nonetheless, it remains quite contingent and fragile, laced with internal dissent and leadership issues. It commands attention now, but, if it is to be truly successful, it will be the first word rather than the last, the advent of a method rather than the founding of a lone institution. If we are lucky and we create some tools and ideas (about which more below), it is the beginning, not the end, of a new strategy and infrastructure for leaking, one built on anonymous drop boxes, encrypted communication, and distributed publishing. WikiLeaks will be, in more than one sense, the Home Motor of this school of activism. If we know what we&rsquo;re doing, WikiLeaks as such could ultimately be the least interesting thing about WikiLeaks &mdash; the first, the crudest, and the most bound to prior orders of publicity, of the strategies to come.</p>
<p>
	This is not to downplay the hard work, the courage, and the daring the WikiLeaks organization. However, the model now most closely associated with WikiLeaks &mdash; the receipt, analysis and redaction of leaked materials inside the organization, and their targeted release in collaboration with major media organizations &mdash; is only one among many. Birgitta J&oacute;nsd&oacute;ttir has <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/episode/2010/12/06/dec-610---pt-1-julian-assange/"">argued in favor</a> of handing off targeted leaks to particular activist organizations best placed to make use of them, rather than the high-visibility international news event of &ldquo;megaleaks.&rdquo; Daniel Domscheit-Berg&rsquo;s <a href=""http://openleaks.org/"">OpenLeaks</a> project, sprung from a critique along similar lines, separates the submission of documents from their publication by providing drop boxes for anonymous web site submissions &mdash; so every group can have their own channel for leaks. Rather than the single point of global submission and distribution, many regional WikiLeaks clones are appearing: <a href=""http://www.indoleaks.org/"">IndoLeaks</a> (for Indonesia), <a href=""https://brusselsleaks.com/"">BrusselsLeaks</a> (the EU), <a href=""http://rospil.info/"">Rospil</a> (Russia), <a href=""http://thaileaks.info/"">ThaiLeaks</a> (Thai-related material on WikiLeaks), <a href=""https://www.balkanleaks.eu/"">BalkanLeaks</a> (the Balkans generally), <a href=""http://www.pinoyleaks.org/"">PinoyLeaks</a> (the Philippines; their superb slogan is &ldquo;Those who engage in Monkey Business should beware of the Monkey-Eating Eagle&rdquo;), <a href=""http://pirateleaks.cz/"">PirateLeaks</a> (the Czech Republic), <a href=""https://tunileaks.appspot.com/"">TuniLeaks</a> (Tunisia-specific materials from the WikiLeaks cable releases) &hellip; There are direct journalistic leaks channels appearing, as well &mdash; consider Al Jazeera&rsquo;s <a href=""http://transparency.aljazeera.net/"">Transparency Unit</a> (returning error messages as of this writing, for some reason), the venue through which the Palestine Papers were leaked, which is a fairly straightforward drop box system.</p>
<p>
	There is no better place than a transitional space like The New Everyday to look to the future, and claim: The centralized motor of WikiLeaks was the first step, and the future belongs to a proliferation of platforms for leaks, power distributed and tailored to its use and its need. We will not just see leak-seeking organizations for cultures, language groups, and nations, but for specific areas of specialization and interest, like pharmaceuticals, agribusiness, mining and resource extraction, finance and banking, manufacturing, intelligence &mdash; the kind of areas where skilled analysis of the material may be necessary, and where groups with existing histories of activism are well-placed to put the material in context, redact anything irresponsible to release, and frame it for maximum impact. Every movement will have the possibility of secure leaks available to it.</p>
<p>
	This is not a prediction of inevitability, however. (Nor is it a wholly positive future; I&rsquo;ll also raise some problems of consequence which must be addressed &mdash; but let us assume that the positive elements of a society with anonymous leaking as a part of the toolbox outweigh the negatives.) If we would like to live in this world, there are several urgent problems that need to be addressed and tools that need to be built. While they overlap somewhat, they can be loosely grouped as infrastructural, social, and legal challenges:</p>
<h2 id=""infrastructural"">
	Infrastructural</h2>
<p>
	The means for securely and anonymously submitting materials are already fairly well established &mdash; though of course they can be improved, and constant vigilance is needed for potential attacks. Real difficulties lie on the publication side, as the struggle to keep WikiLeaks online demonstrates. There are two aspects to this problem:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			We need to create simple and reliable means for mirroring sites and to navigate to those sites in a trustworthy way, so that adversaries leaning on your ISP (so your material is removed from the server) and pulling your DNS (so that readers can no longer navigate to your domain name) can&rsquo;t expunge your data. There are alternative systems for a <a href=""http://dot-p2p.org/index.php?title=Main_Page"">peer-to-peer domain name infrastructure</a> being developed; a similar longer term project being discussed is the creation of a protocol to mirror sites over BitTorrent, so that if the main site is under attack, it can pass requests on to peers without the reader/requester having to leave their browser &mdash; a step towards a truly uncensorable network.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			WikiLeaks, as the bellwether, has made clear that the funding and donation system is broken when it comes to supporting anything truly contentious or potentially problematic. Methods are needed for funding organizations that are releasing leaked material in their moment of greatest need, when they may be operating overseas and under close governmental scrutiny. Projects like <a href=""http://www.bitcoin.org/"">Bitcoin</a> (AnonNews is currently <a href=""http://anonnews.org/bitcoin.html"">taking Bitcoin donations</a>) suggest steps in this direction &mdash; though a far simpler solution may lie not in the creation of new transaction systems, but in existing nonprofits and activist groups managing leaks as one aspect of their operation, which doesn&rsquo;t imperil their funding stream and access to their resources.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Finally, an additional infrastructural element we must work on is a system for undetectably copying documents and other materials. The Afghan War logs and the SIPRnet cables were likely flukes, with nothing on a similar scale to be made available to authorized users again without systems for logging access and requests, and provided in formats that are very difficult to download to a local machine or circulate online. Techniques and workflows for gathering data and making it portable will be vital.</p>
<h2 id=""social"">
	Social</h2>
<p>
	The points of real security failure for an organization with leak-receiving capabilities are social, not technical. The sole alleged source to be compromised in the history of WikiLeaks appears to have been identified by discussing his activities with a colleague he thought trustworthy. For secure leaking to be a viable and distributed strategy, three elements would be helpful:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			People who work with leaks in an organization must have training in operations security and risk management &mdash; the tradecraft of learning how to travel, communicate, behave and collaborate in secure ways. OPSEC and its related disciplines are already well understood in the military and intelligence communities; we need an activist/geek-friendly training program to produce leak recipients capable of protecting their organizations and themselves.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			One crucial step in that regard would be greater general familiarity with secure communication online. It has never been easier to browse safely (using Tor), encrypt e-mail (using programs like GPG), and chat both securely and deniably (using the Off-the-Record protocol). Spread these habits, so you and your colleagues can use them before they become urgently necessary.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			The act of leaking puts one at potentially enormous risk for the sake of moral courage. It&rsquo;s easy to be dismissive of social security failures &mdash; just don&rsquo;t talk about what you&rsquo;ve done, to anyone, ever &mdash; but the need for companionship and solidarity, especially given the danger a leaker faces, is profound. To keep secrets of that magnitude, without the benefit of friend, therapist, or confessional, is wearing. A way to enable community and alliance without the danger of discovery would be well worthwhile.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=""legal"">
	Legal</h2>
<p>
	The last issue is a legal one &mdash; not simply the legal status of leak-distributing groups, the freedom of speech issues they face, and so on, but clarifying the gray area of legal protection for those who mirror the information. If mirroring is to play its necessary role in the distributed publication of leaks in the future, those who would create mirror sites need to know the risks they run, in terms of their hosting services (can my hosting contract or personal website be terminated?), their relationship to their employers, and the possibility of pressure from the government. What can they expect, and what means of redress are available to them?</p>
<h2 id=""problems_of_consequence"">
	Problems of consequence</h2>
<p>
	Finally, there are problems of the longer-term consequences the wide availability of secure leaking; I don&rsquo;t have answers to these questions, and I invite comments.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			Authentication. The culture of journalistic leaks includes existing relationships of trust, and their patient cultivation, between the journalist and the leaker. It&rsquo;s how journalists keep from disseminating disinformation and propaganda. In the absence of trust between leakers and the fourth estate, where one can&rsquo;t know the other, how do we avoid irresponsible and scurrilous and outright fabricated information? Worst case scenario number one: the first 21st-century <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion""><em>Protocols of the Elders of Zion</em></a>, a hate-justifying counterfeit whose pretense of legitimacy partially springs from presenting itself as secret knowledge revealed. Do we need anonymous reputational systems to build trusted relationships with repeat leakers? Double agents have already demonstrated the technique of building trust through true, secret, but nonvital information that builds the relationship for lies down the road.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Analysis. WikiLeaks works very hard to maintain their analytic layer for the leaks they receive, and journalism has historically had people who will read through all those tedious pages of Pentagon memos to put the significant story together. Can we trust the magic pixie dust of crowdsourcing to handle this? Are we building in stovepiping (as in Cheney wanting to read all the raw intelligence, pre-analysis, and feeding his own paranoia and desire for unilateral power) for the entire population? Will good information actually drive out bad? Worst case scenario number two: a population whipped into a frenzy and marching to war because of the kind of wildly overstated threats presented by self-serving informers and spies with their own agendas &mdash; the sort of stuff actual intelligence analysts know to discard, filter, or read with a grain of contextual salt. It&rsquo;s the Iraq War all over again, but we did it to ourselves. Imagine Glenn Beck and his epigones getting their hands on such material.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			The end of libel. Worst case scenario three, from the city-state of Florence (among other Renaissance metropoli): the <em>tamburo,</em> or anonymous letter-box, which existed for citizens to drop secret denunciations of one another, leading to a constant series of political struggles in which the accused could never face their accusers. Like political character attacks and the work of oppo research, but vastly more widespread, a culture of rampant self-policing, informers, and the possibility of betrayal.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	With those problems said, and awaiting further thought, I would like to close with the positive dimension of the leaking project. There come moments, sometimes, in human lives when an exigent power comes over us, against all rational and self-interested calculation, to act for what we take to be good in the face of institutions, individuals, and cultures that would prefer not to know, and would prefer to say, in the words of Alphonso Lingis, &ldquo;what one says, what everyone and anyone says.&rdquo; We are faced with a call of conscience &mdash; Heidegger called it the voice of the friend, Nietzsche the &ldquo;evil conscience&rdquo; that obliges us to step forward, to be uniquely and particularly human. There are many ways to answer this demand; one way, if the person called is in a position to do so, is to release secret information, take another step towards the whole picture, and enter into history. What we are in a position to do, by following the lead of WikiLeaks and building the capacity for a multiplicity of leaks, is to enable many others to answer their call of conscience, to make them more addressable by ethical demand. We can make WikiLeaks itself the least interesting part of a new environment of personal privacy and institutional disclosure.</p>

<p>
	The public focus on social media and the Egyptian insurrection has, like the display of branded graffiti on the streets of Cairo, occluded the processes that produced this event. The Egyptian uprising of 2011 is an historic turning point for many reasons, not least of which is the rise of a new network sovereignty among the mutants of mediated multitudes. News accounts of the Tahrir Square events focused on one major divide: sovereign power of Mubarak (depicted in the repetition of his face on street signs) vs. &lsquo;people-power&rdquo; (conveyed via images of crowds in these streets). We&rsquo;re witnessing a reconfiguration of network power, new distributed asymmetries beyond the molar cut between network (freedom) and state/institutional (power). We need to train our eyes to see the proliferation of these mutations.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the February 11 Day of Victory, Tahrir Square contained a message assembled on the street (in relief): &ldquo;We are the Men of Facebook.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this gesture, the crowds were hailed to witness the revelation of the social media plotters who became the leadership core of the Revolutionary Youth Movement.<a href=""#_edn1"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[i]</a>&nbsp; In other words, the plotters simultaneously self-revealed and made a bid to become the representatives of the protestors. State Department official-turned-Google official Jared Cohen tweeted that this was a &quot;basically leaderless&quot; movement, This is accurate insofar as no <em>visible</em> representation presented itself from the outset. But the presumption here is that the lack of visibility equals lack of existence.<a href=""#_edn2"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[ii]</a> Instead, we can say the young plotters announced themselves at the precise moment when leadership was strategically useful to come out of the shadows.<img src=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/we_are_the_men_of_facebook.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what was lurking in those shadows?&nbsp; We can startwith Jared Cohen&rsquo;svery visible Google co-worker, Wael Ghonim. &nbsp;Ghonim, after vanishing in Cairo for almost two weeks, reappeared with a teary interview on Egypt&rsquo;s DreamTV on February 7, followed by a western media blitz via CNN, 60 minutes, Time magazine and other outlets. On Tues the 8th, Time already promoted him as potentially &ldquo;the leader of the faceless group of young revolutionaries,&rdquo;Foreign Policy claimed Mubarak&rsquo;s regime &ldquo;may have just created an undisputed leader for a movement that in recent days has struggled to find its footing,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal called him a key figure who was &ldquo;adopted as symbolic leader&rdquo; by protest organizers, while CNN posed the question &ldquo;is he not inevitably the <em>spiritual</em> leader&quot;? This noopolitician<a href=""#_edn3"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[iii]</a> told Wolf Blitzer that &quot;This revolution started online,&quot; specifically that it &ldquo;started on Facebook.&rdquo; When asked about what happens after Egypt, the Google exec replied, &ldquo;Ask Facebook.&quot;&nbsp;<img src=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/wael_ghonim.thumbnail.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some reasons for Ghonim&rsquo;s deference to Facebook are obvious. During his DreamTV interview, he revealed that he was the Facebook page admin for &ldquo;We are All Khalid Said,&rdquo; a key mobilizing site for the uprising. Going by the moniker El Shaheed (The Martyr), Ghonim shrouded himself in the identity of an actual martyr (the first version of the page was &ldquo;My Name is Khalid Said&rdquo;). A lesser-known reason for Ghonim&rsquo;s praise was his access to Facebook security admins. When his first page was shut down for not using a proper email, he was given a loophole to overcome the impasse by Richard Allan, Facebook&rsquo;s director of policy for Europe. Allan also noted that Facebook &ldquo;put all the key pages into special protection&rdquo; so that they would not be closed down by Mubarak&rsquo;s forces. The mysterious Ghonim admitted that he had an &ldquo;open line&rdquo; of communication with Facebook throughout the 18 days of the uprising. While many can become friends on Facebook, few can be friends <em>with</em> Facebook a la Ghonim.<a href=""#_edn4"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[iv]</a> No wonder, then, that soon after his resurfacing, a Facebook group called <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/Authorize.Ghoneim"">&#39;I delegate Wael Ghonim to speak in the name of Egypt&#39;s revolutionaries&#39;</a> emerged (prefiguring the street revelation by the RYM later that week).</p>
<p>

<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Ghonim is only one figure, one whose hypermediated visibility occludes the larger story of a complex of institutional actors involved in fomenting a social media revolution. Let&rsquo;s start by going back to Jared Cohen, our Google Ideas exec.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
	Cohen&rsquo;s last significant media appearance was in the summer of 2009. During peak moments in the June Iranian demonstrations a Twitter co-founder was emailed and asked to delay a scheduled maintenance downtime. Who made the request?&nbsp;Jared Cohen, who was then working for the State Department. His major contribution during his tenure there was as co-founder of something called the Alliance of Youth Movements (AYM).<img src=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/aoym-new-watch.thumbnail.png"" />&nbsp;Launched in 2008 with a&nbsp;summit in New York City, the AYM gathered together an ensemble of media corporations, Obama consultants, social network entrepreneurs, and youth organizations, under the auspices of the State Department. Representatives came from Old Media (MTV, NBC, CNN) and New (Google and Facebook). The AYM created an online Howcast Hub, which &ldquo;brings together youth leaders from around the world to learn, share &amp; discuss how to change the world by building powerful grassroots movements&rdquo; (Alliance of Youth Movements). Among the series of how-to videos produced for the site: How to Create a Grassroots Movement Using Social-Networking Sites, How to Smart Mob, How to Circumvent an Internet Proxy. Undersecretary James Glassman described the event as &ldquo;Public Diplomacy 2.0.&rdquo;<a href=""#_edn5"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[v]</a></p>
<p>
	<img src=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/pubdiplomacy2.0.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	Elsewhere I have called this Alliance an example of a &ldquo;Genetically Modified Grassroots Organization&rdquo; (GMGO). Neither wholly emerging from below (grassroots) nor purely invented by external forces (the astroturfing done by public relations groups), emergent groups are <em>seeded</em> (and their genetic code altered) to control the vector of the movement. These are hybrids, mutations without clear identities or immediately obvious affinities.&nbsp; They are rather movements whose potentialities are shaped by their conditions of emergence. How are we to make sense of these mutants?</p>
<p>
	We can begin with an agential cut that distributes these actors. In residual Cold-War logic, the sovereign adversaries like Iran and Egypt are said to have State-<em>run</em> mass media (which needs to be fought via social media). On the other hand, Twitter-usage in Iran as well as Facebook (and Google) in Egypt follow a certain model set out by AYM in terms of tactics and, most importantly, <em>objectives</em>. We can say that the US has State-<em>friended</em> social media. In the case of Egypt, we know that at least one of the April 6 Movement leaders attended the 2008 summit.&nbsp; Moreover, according to WikiLeaked State Department documents, another activist (name redacted) affiliated with the Egyptian revolt also participated in the conference.&nbsp; Regardless of whether this &ldquo;secret agent&rdquo; eventually reveals him/herself and the direct links to Egypt&rsquo;s RYM, we can note the importance of AYM and its tactics (as well as its co-founder).</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AYM here acts as a programmer of social media movements. It simulates grassroots by working with elements of it, replicating and disseminating tactics. In the case of Egypt, the Revolutionary Youth Movement demonstrated that (to revise the Arquilla and Ronfeldt mantra) it takes a network to fake a network. A small group embedded among the crowds, hidden at times until representation required revelation, sought to cloak itself in the martyrdom of one and the will of many. The network of emergent leadership needed to take enough credit for its organizing and mobilizing in order to claim legitimacy as representatives while simultaneously negating its actions in &ldquo;the people.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ghonim and others manage their publicity and secrecy, strategically donning online disguises while revealing themselves as the faces behind the facebook group. In their final act they transform themselves from technocratic tricksters into &ldquo;youth.&rdquo;<a href=""#_edn6"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[vi]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emergent leadership is a logical outcome of a statecraft that for over a decade devoted itself to netwar.&nbsp; Rand Corporation studies of leaderless resistance focused on both state and non-state actors.The Egyptian hybrid is of non-state actor and <em>future</em> state actor, of the <em>not-yet</em> state actors. Yet not too far away are state (department) actors as well as the state-friended media actors comprising the milieu out of which a specific network individuates itself.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The preface to another Rand collection edited by Arquilla and Ronfeldt gives us a way of conceptualizing this individuation. Alvin &amp; Heidi Toffler (1997) introduce the notion of a &ldquo;deep coalition&rdquo; comprised of a variety of state and nonstate actors in a multidimensional and nonequilibrial alliance. Tiziana Terranova understands this deep coalition as a <em>dispositif</em> within information warfare, &ldquo;a model whereby some parts of the media system no longer function as passive outlets for government propaganda but become instead active and equal members of a network of alliance (or deep coalition) that connects heterogeneous partners bound by a temporary commitment to a specific project of warfare&rdquo; (Terranova 2007 132).</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the recent cases of &ldquo;social media revolution,&rdquo; this dispositif encompasses the AYM, but would also include such Federal agencies as the Defense Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors that have been funding technology firms (e.g. the Tor Project and UltraReach) that provide institutional-technical fixes to users who need to work around State-run blockages and surveillance. The State Department, perhaps following up on the success of AYM, is gearing up to spend approximately $30 million on technology companies and human rights groups to help and train people to avoid online detection and break through firewalls.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, Egypt&rsquo;s revolt was not leaderless, but contained a hidden emergent leadership whose milieu (unstable and temporary though it was) warrants scrutiny. It means examining <em>initial conditions</em>: the code that unleashes and controls the directions of probable emergences (and even their subsequent selection). Leadership here did not naturally arise from grassroots spontaneous popular will.&nbsp; An individuated network helped set the initial conditions, disappeared within them temporarily, and then made itself known when the time was right. In other words, we witnessed an occult leadership arise based on the skillful use of anonymity and revelation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The GMGO is a genetic principle that immerses without becoming immanent, a mix of unpredictable elements and shaping factors that seek to set the parameters and selections for composition and state transition. Success is not guaranteed, but the range of virtuals and their likely actualization is guided by an embedded but relatively occulted agency (or in the case of Ghonim, a spectacular secret agency).<a href=""#_edn7"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[vii]</a>&nbsp; Ultimately then we <em>can</em> call Egypt a &lsquo;cyber-revolution&rsquo; if we keep in mind the etymological origins in the Greek <em>kyber</em>, meaning to steer or govern.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Egyptian kybernitiki (or steerers) are an example of what Galloway and Thacker note as the convergence of sovereign and network powers. Is the GMGO a case of total programming? Network sovereignty expresses new modes of control, but doesn&rsquo;t exhaust the topology of power. The mutant network sovereigns also set the conditions for new forms of antagonism.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GMGO network sovereignty is predicated on asymmetries. For one thing, we have to ask, &ldquo;who is able to set initial conditions?&rdquo; Who has the resources and capacities to form such deep coalitions?&nbsp; The hybrids of state and nonstate actors convened by the State Department at the AYM, along with the decentralized flows of tech and financial support produce an <em>accumulation</em> of mechanisms.&nbsp; At the same time, an accumulation of this sort does not exist in isolation&mdash;it delineates an antagonism. Network sovereignty, it turns out, individuates itself via the classic distinction between friend and enemy. State-friended media can thrive only upon the repression and dissuasion of other individuations of social media usage. The determination of friendliness immediately encounters a peer hybrid, a &ldquo;State-enemied&rdquo; media usage.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take, for instance, the well-worn story about despotic attempts at blocking or criminalizing net usage. Part of Mubarak&rsquo;s sovereign abuse (or &ldquo;stupidity&rdquo; as Ghonim called it) was to try and stop social media access. Meanwhile, Barack Obama and Congress have been working on a controversial bill that would allow US government takeover of privately owned computer systems under a declared &quot;national cyberemergency,&quot; (one not to be reviewed by courts).</p>
<p>
	How would these takeovers be determined?&nbsp; Maybe we should ask Eliot Madison, part of the Tin Can Comms Collective during the 2009 G20 protests in Pittsburgh, PA. His use of Twitter during the demos (which was tame in comparison with AYM&rsquo;s own How-To videos) resulted in his being charged with &ldquo;criminal use of a communication facility, hindering apprehension or prosecution, and possession of instruments of crime.&rdquo; Or ask members of Anonymous, who were arrested on warrants issued <em>at the same time</em> our collective gaze was on Tahrir Square crowds and Ghonim&rsquo;s noopolitics.</p>
<p>
	The context defining State-enemied media usage is of course a Terror-War discourse. Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Alicalled the activists in his country &ldquo;terrorists,&rdquo; while pundits in the US routinely use the terrorism designation for Anonymous and Julian Assange. More officially, Pentagon personnel refer to domestic dissent as &ldquo;low-level terrorist activity.&rdquo; And recent raids on antiwar activists in Minneapolis were, according to the FBI, carried out to root out &quot;activities concerning the material support of terrorism.&rdquo; The FBI&rsquo;s four major categories of domestic terrorism include &ldquo;anarchist extremism,&rdquo; which encompasses anti-globalization and anti-capitalist movements (which could be said to apply to the G20 protestors such as Madison).</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Network sovereignty has agendas against agency, especially that of the &ldquo;unspecified enemy.&rdquo; And this is ultimately the source of public secret asymmetries, in which the US projects its own network sovereign shadow activities out onto individual sovereigns. What happens when these shadows come back into public awareness?&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s take it straight from one of the network sovereigns within a deep coalition: Daniel B. Baer, deputy assistant secretary in the State Department, said the department is &ldquo;unequivocal in its support of a free Internet and the rights of protesters in the Middle East as well as <em>other regions where governments restrict Web use or monitor dissident movements</em> (italics added). What might Anonymous do with this opening, this exploit? Perhaps we, as Guy Debord once hoped, can make use of what is hidden from us.&nbsp; Otherwise, we might as well continue to generate content not as users, but as used.</p>

Initially called into being to coordinate Internet pranking and trolling, in the winter of 2008 it also became a narrowly focused protest movement rallying against the abuses of the Church of Scientology. In September 2010 a distinct political arm also emerged under the guise of Operation Payback to protest the Motion Player Association of America (MPAA), and a few months later, like so much of the world&#39;s attention, this arm shifted its energies to Wikileaks. It was this manifestation of Anonymous that attracted so much media coverage due the spectacular waves of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks they launched in support of Wikileaks. Despite this notoriety and despite the fact that Anonymous had already coordinated protests against the Church of Scientology, commentators struggled to describe its ethics, sociology, and history using traditional analytical categories.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	This difficulty follows from the fact that Anonymous is, like its name suggests, shrouded in some degree of mystery, a form cultural obfuscation perpetuated knowingly at times as a political tactic by its it participants; it also purports to have no leaders, no hierarchical structure, nor any geographical epicenter. Indeed while there are forms of organization and cultural logics that undeniably shape its multiple expressions, it is a name that any individual or group can, in theory, take on as their own. In this capacity, Anonymous functions as what Marco Deseriis describes as an improper name: &ldquo;The adoption of the same alias by organized collectives, affinity groups, and individual authors.&rdquo;<sup><a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote1sym"" name=""sdfootnote1anc""><sup>1</sup></a> </sup>For instance, those coordinating the DDoS attacks may not be the same people who write manifestos, or launch blogs or news sites under this name; the protests in support of Wikileaks were, for the most part, unconnected to Anonymous currently protesting the abuses of the Church of Scientology, a fact overlooked by many writing on this topic.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	In the rest of the piece, my aims are modest and narrow. I will provide a brief and truncated historical description of how the multiple political operations under the banner of Anonymous came into being and then offer, in broad strokes, some of its key organizational and ethical logics. Although in no way should this be taken as comprehensive, it will, I hope clear up some of the more common misconceptions surrounding Anonymous and its operations. In so doing, we will see how part, although not all, of Anonymous has over the last three years moved from disaggregated practices rooted in the culture of trolling to a collective form of action and identification catalyzed and moved forward by a series of political interventions, from protesting Scientology to supporting the Middle Eastern protests, giving rise to new form of political subject Anonymous.</p>

	<b>Political Birth</b></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	Anonymous emerged out of an enormously popular and anonymous image board, 4chan and was primarily associated with a phenomena&mdash;trolling&mdash;known at times to unfold there. On 4chan, once a target is chosen, trolling usually takes on an unpredictable combination of the following: telephone pranking, many unpaid pizzas are sent to the target&#39; home, DDoSing, and most especially splattering personal and the most humiliating possible information all over the Internet. Since at least 2006, many such acts were called into being by &ldquo;Anonymous.&rdquo; The motivating force and consequence of many acts of trolling, including those on 4chan, are cited as the &ldquo;lulz.&rdquo; A pluralization and bastardization of laugh out loud (lol), it denotes the pleasures of trolling, but the lulz sits on a spectrum. It can also refer more generally to more lighthearted and amusing jokes, images, and pranks.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">In 2008 a now legendary wave of trolling occurred when Anonymous </font><font face=""Times"">decided to unleash their collective, unpredictable fury against the Church of Scientology. They did so after the</font><font face=""Times""> Church made a vigorous attempt to halt the circulation of an internal church <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFBZ_uAbxS0"">video</a> featuring Tom Cruise who was exuberantly praising the practices and theology of Scientology. Soon after the Church threatened publishers, such as Gawker, with legal action (citing violation of the DMCA) if they did not take down the video, Anonymous led a series of what they call &ldquo;raids&rdquo; against the Church between January 15</font><sup><font face=""Times"">th</font></sup><font face=""Times""> and January 27</font><sup><font face=""Times"">th</font></sup><font face=""Times""> 2008, accurately described by one participant as &ldquo;ultra-coordinated motherfuckary.&rdquo;</font><font face=""Times""> </font><font face=""Times"">Consistent with previous actions, Anonymous was trolling the Church of Scientology largely for the sake of the lulz, picking on a target that geeks love to hate.</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">Soon after the first waves of trolling, the course of Anonymous veered toward more traditional political territory after some participants organized a world-wide day of street protests. What led to this change and these protests? Surprisingly a set of videos were key actors in securing this change of heart. Over the course of a week in late January of 2008, a cluster of videos were made and circulated, material that led to days of debate as to the purpose and meaning of their raiding. The first and the now the most famous <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCbKv9yiLiQ"">declared war against the Church of Scientology</a>, however it was <a href=""http://encyclopediadramatica.com/I_did_it_for_the_lulz"">made just for the lulz</a>. Five days later another video appeared, this time made by a long-time critic of the Church Mark Bunker who <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW466xcM0Yk"">asked Anonymous to reconsider</a> it trollish tactics and move toward more serious and especially legal political actions. This was soon followed by a more sincere call for political action by Anonymous.</font><font face=""Times""><b> </b></font><font face=""Times"">As thousands viewed these home-made videos, they</font><font face=""Times""><b> </b></font><font face=""Times"">worked to </font><font face=""Times"">catalyze a period of heated debate on IRC channels and one of the questions repeatedly posed was whether Anonymous should leave the Internet to protest the Church.</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">Enough participants decided to move forward with organizing a day of action. On February 10, 2008 over six thousand people protested across the United States, Canada, Europe, New Zealand, and Australia, many in front of Scientology Churches. These actions were impressive for their high levels of attendance and aesthetic bravado, which included a performance of their anonymity. Most protesters arrived wearing Guy Fawkes masks, now a staple part of Anonymous&#39; iconography.</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">What was noteworthy about these protests is how they were populated by sizable </font><font face=""Times"">chunk of protesters who lacked what we commonly associate with street protests: political intentionality and consciousness. It was a carnivalesque scene straight out of a geeky and at times offensive, but also quite playful bunker of Internet culture. People were making fun of the Church and speaking in hyper-charged Internet jargon about <a href=""http://www.lolcats.com/"">lol cats</a>, <a href=""http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Long_cat"">long cats</a>, the lulz, <a href=""http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Mudkip"">mudkips</a> and so on. </font><font face=""Times""> </font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">Soon after this global day of protests, a separation of peoples occurred, many participants receding back to the Internet from whence they came. Those that remained continue into the present to organize more traditional protests focused on human rights abuses of the church and now don a more recognizable political subjectivity. &ldquo;I came for the lulz but stayed for the outrage,&rdquo; as one Irish Anonymous participant told me in August, a sentiment expressed by many. The lulz, however, did not simply evaporate.</font><font face=""Times""><font size=""3""> Protesters engage in a difficult juggling act between traditional street protest and the more wild, grotesque, humorous, and offensive elements that are part and parcel of the lulz. </font></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">Starting in the winter of 2008 and continuing on through the fall of 2010, the more traditional political face of Anonymous was largely, although not exclusively, stitched to lambasting the abuses of the Church of Scientology.</font><sup><font face=""Times""><a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote2sym"" name=""sdfootnote2anc""><sup>2</sup></a></font></sup><font face=""Times""> In September 2010 the name Anonymous was yet again mobilized on 4chan to launch a new operation: Operation Payback. Coming in the form of politically motivated DDoS attacks, Anonymous targeted the MPAA (<a href=""http://www.myce.com/news/anonymous-operation-payback-timeline-infographic-36481/"">and eventually other organizations and companies</a>) to show support for the famous file-sharing site, the<a href=""http://thepiratebay.org/""> Pirate Bay</a> soon after their servers were DdoSed by an Indian software firm that had been hired by the MPAA to engage in this form of digital privateering.</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">The operation was first concocted on 4chan but inevitably left and partially moved to IRC because coordinating on an anonymous image board is not exactly practical. This operation was sociologically unconnected to the protests against the Church of Scientology as it was largely a different group of people initiating the actions, although some crossed over, and it was organized on different Internet Relay Chat networks as well. </font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">In December 2010 soon after Wikileaks released a small trove of diplomatic cables, those participating in Operation Payback shifted their energies to engage in the largest and most spectacular set of actions to date. Anonymous did not protest simply to register its support of Wikileaks; they launched into actions due to the fact that PayPal, Mastercard, and Amazon decided to pull all support and services for Wikileaks despite the fact that the organization had not even been charged with any infraction, much less proven guilty of anything.</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">This operation, which disabled the websites of some of the world&rsquo;s most powerful corporations for a few days, was in many ways exceptional. Due to the large infantry of geeks that logged on to IRC to watch or lend a helping hand&mdash;at one point there were over seven thousand people on the main IRC channel&mdash;this operation led to one of the most populated channels in the history of Internet Relay Chat. Despite the chaotic feel to the interaction due to these numbers, they managed to control the DDoS with a notable degree of deliberation and care. For instance, participants chose targets through polling, they collectively wrote documents to explain who and who not to attack, and constantly reminded participants of this on IRC.</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times""><b>Image</b></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">Not all participants took part in these tactics. Others took it upon themselves to make and release dozens of images and videos. In this period those protesting the Church continued to do so, some of them lending a helping hand within this node of Anonymous, many were just watching to see what would happen, and others, like a number of geeks and hackers, were ethically appraising the use of DDoS as a tactic for protest and dissent.</font><sup><font face=""Times""><a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote3sym"" name=""sdfootnote3anc""><sup>3</sup></a></font></sup></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">Soon after these attacks died down, Anonymous lent a helping hand in what seemed to be an unlikely place: Tunisia, and did so well before the North American and European media even started to report on it, at least with any depth and accuracy. On January 2, 2001 they initiated &ldquo;OpTunisia&rdquo; after the government blocked Wikileaks from the Internet and they continued to offer aid as street protests swept the country. In keeping with tradition, they DDoSed government and tourist websites but also funneled</font><font face=""Times""> out of Tunisia of the street violence and created packets for Tunisian cyberactivists and protesters providing information for evading governmental surveillance. In their care packet, some of them also gestured toward the very limits of their own cyberacitivism by stating &ldquo;This is *your* revolution. It will neither be Twittered nor televised or IRC&#39;ed. You *must* hit the streets or you *will* loose the fight. Always stay safe, once you got [sic] arrested you cannot do anything for yourself or your people. Your government *is* watching you.&rdquo;</font><sup><font face=""Times""><a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote4sym"" name=""sdfootnote4anc""><sup>4</sup></a></font></sup><font face=""Times""> </font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">OpTunisia, in many respects, represented another turning point in the political formation of Anonymous as a protest movement. Whereas most previous operations resided in the realm of Internet politics or censorship, this operation moved more squarely into human rights activism as it converged with an existing movement and attracted a large number of participants. Since this period Anonymous has continued to initiate a diverse range of operations. As Tunisia helped spark the astounding protests in Egypt, attention moved there. Along with operations in Libya and New Zealand and many other places, they have also led attacks in Italy as Silvio Berlusconi faced accusations of sleeping with a minor and in Wisconsin to protest the law that seeks to shred collective bargaining rights for public unions. Just this week they aggressively targeted Sony as a response to the lawsuits this corporate giant has issued against two gamer-hackers who have bypassed the digital protections on the PlayStation 3.</font></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">Now that we have a basic historical picture in place, I want to turn to the following questions centered on its social organization and behavioral norms: who</font> participates in Anonymous? What connects the different faces? Where and how does authority lie, pool, and disperse?</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	Technically Anonymous is open to all and it exhibits a significant degree of participatory openness. However there are forms of tacit and explicit knowledge, skills, sympathies, and know-how that lead some people and not others to politically engage in this domain. But in contrast to some organizations, including Wikileaks, it is easier to contribute to Anonymous as it offers, among other possibilities, micro-protest opportunities coordinated at the drop of a hat with no formal barriers to entry, although it helps to have some technical skills.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	A small cadre of participants in Anonymous are <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/09/the-anthropology-of-hackers/63308/"">hackers</a>:<font face=""Times""> these are skilled programmers and system administrators who identify as such and many, although not all, are motivated by some version of information freedom. A much larger group I would describe not as hackers, but instead provisionally and with qualifications, as &ldquo;geeks.&rdquo; These geek participants hold a number of digital media literacies such as video editing, design skills, and enough technical know-how to be able to use Internet Relay Chat, collaborative writing tools, and hold ethical sympathies, such as commitments to freedom of information, that make Anonymous politically attractive in the first place. Other participants may not qualify as either nor identify as geeks but over time by participating in this digital domain, they too start to learn some of the basic forms of digital literacies that might perhaps may make them, over time, into geeks</font><sup><font face=""Times""><a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote5sym"" name=""sdfootnote5anc""></a></font></sup></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">To grasp some of the power dynamics at play in Anonymous, it is imperative to address the technical architecture where many spend a significant time chatting and coordinating action: IRC. </font>It is worth restating there are currently two distinct and unconnected IRC networks where participants coordinate different efforts: Anonet and Anonops. These are, so contrary to a number of media reports, open to the public; it is just that a good deal of the public has no idea how to find or use Internet Relay Chat. One arm of Anonymous even provides a <a href=""http://irc.lc/AnonOps/lounge/WebAnon@@@@"">link to their server</a> on their website.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	Within each IRC network there are also dozens upon dozens of channels, although there are usually only a dozen that are well populated at one time. There are some channels that are devoted to social topics and lighthearted and humorous (re: lulzy) banter as the lulz is still valued among many participants. The lulz provides &ldquo;a release valve,&rdquo; as one participant explained, a valve that makes the hard and sometimes depressing work of political engagement more bearable. Other channels exist to address technical issues, and of course, there are also multiple channels where the many political operations are coordinated; some participants have a pivotal role to play in many of them, others are only involved in a few channels.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	On IRC there is a class of participants who hold more authority: those vested with infrastructural power: the IRC operators (&ldquo;ops&rdquo; are common to all IRC networks not only those of Anonymous). Tasked with maintaining order, they have the power to kick and ban individuals from the IRC network, which they will do for various reasons, including violating network and cultural norms, such as constantly connecting and disconnecting or in the case of Anonops, targeting the media or promoting violence. The are not only a handful of ops. There are dozens of them. To be an op you also don&#39;t have to be technically skilled. Ops become so by putting in work and as a result do carry more authority. Although their opinions carry more weight during the many debates that unfold on these networks, they do not determine the course of every action or operation within Anonymous.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	Authority and order are also embodied in policy, ethical sensibilities, and norms that develop over time and often are in reaction to historical events. Participants across both networks are oriented towards issues of censorship, information freedom, and as their very name signals, they tend to be overwhelmingly committed to the long-standing liberal idea&nbsp; that <a href=""https://www.eff.org/issues/anonymity"">anonymous speech</a> is necessary for a functioning and healthy democratic society. In the case of Anonops there is now an established policy to refrain attacking the media, even in countries where the media is known to be a corrupt arm of state power, as in Iran. This provision is not universally accepted and there have been periods when some participants have violated this norm, leading to what is common to any political protest movement: debate and disagreement.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	Finally to understand the dynamics of power and authority in Anonymous one must confront what is one of the most interesting, prevalent, and socially-alive norms within Anonymous: its anti-leader and anti-celebrity ethic&mdash;an ethic that modulates, even if it does not fully eliminate, the concentration of power. <font face=""Times"">Anonymous provides what Mike Wesch had described as &ldquo;a scathing critique of the postmodern cult of celebrity, individualism, and identity while serving itself as the inverted alternative.&rdquo;<a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote6sym"" name=""sdfootnote6anc""><sup>6</sup></a> It is key to note that participants don&#39;t only wax philosophical about this commitment; they enact it. Participants remind each other with remarkable frequency that one should not behave like a leader, nor seek personal attention in the media, called &ldquo;name fagging&rdquo; or &ldquo;leaderfagging.&rdquo;</font><sup><font face=""Times""><a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote7sym"" name=""sdfootnote7anc""><sup>7</sup></a></font></sup><font face=""Times""> If you do, you most certainly will receive a private or public drubbing, and if you have called a lot of attention to yourself, then with a mere keystroke, you might be instantly banished from IRC. </font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">I was recently witness to just this very thing after a participant had been to public about himself to a reporter, an anon who had not even put himself at risk by participating in the DDoS attacks. After reading the article where he had been featured, one Anonymous condensed the collective mood in a mere sentence: &ldquo;Attempting to use all the work that so many have done for your personal promotion is something i will not tolerate.&rdquo; Then he was killed off, exiled, as he was banished from the IRC network. </font><font face=""Times""><b> </b></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">Does the existence of this ethic mean that power never pools, that there are no forms of authority? Is Anonymous just living out a lie? No. To be sure, when it comes to certain actions, such as targeted hacking, only a small group of talented hackers can successfully pull this off. This fact, however, does not mean, as this Gawker piece <a href=""http://gawker.com/#!5783173/inside-anonymous-secret-war-room"">argued</a></font><font face=""Times""> that a small group of hackers are </font><font face=""Times""><i>the</i></font><font face=""Times""> leaders; they are confusing the power to hack, which is certainly powerful, with the power to lead all actions within Anonymous. As stated those who are more present on the network and have put in more work carry more authority. A more compelling rendition of these power dynamics would examine the dialectic between the creation of centralized power and its dispersal, which is so common to many other geeky and hacker domains of collaboration (link to two pieces). The fact that they constantly remind each othernot to behave like a leader pushes participants to strive for consensus as the preferred mode of decisions making.</font></p>
<p align=""CENTER"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times""><b>**</b></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">Due to its multifaceted, layered, and rhizomatic attributes, Anonymous, as this informative article has argued persuasively, is a challenge to study. However, is Anonymous simply, as the piece concludes: &ldquo; Cyber-lynch mobs that are organized via the Internet, who share the common meme of &ldquo;Anonymous&rdquo;, where a few people say &quot;hey let&#39;s do this&quot;, and those of like mind go do it while the others sit it out and post<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> lolcat </span></font><font face=""Times""> pictures on 4chan.&rdquo; If one spends time examining the political arms of Anonymous, it is clear that they have enough coherence, history, and ethical substance to separate them, at least in some fashion, from some other facets; even if trolling is still one of the actions coordinated under this moniker, the whole of the Anonymous cannot simply be reduced to cyber-lynching, nor can the whole of Anonymous be reduced to the forms of politics I have examined here.</font></p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">Although I have sought to contextualize Anonymous within the cultural milieu from which it arose (4chan, trolling, and the lulz), I have primarily honed in on the various political expressions of Anonymous. We can locate the political arms of Anonymous by virtue of the IRC networks they use, the regular participants who show up to contribute their time and their labor, the messages they broadcast via videos, manifestos, and messages, and the norms by which they have devised and enact. In this piece I have only scratched at the surface as to how authority, ethical and behavioral norms, and political tactics arise and function within some nodes of Anonymous.</font>&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">But we can already note how Anonymous, since the winter of 2008, due to it being a very non-traditional mechanism of actions, acts as a political gateway for a great mass of geeks to take action. Anonymous provides low-barrier, flexible minimal commitment, discrete micro-protest possibilities that aren&#39;t otherwise there in a way that allow individuals to be part of something greater. You don&#39;t have to fill out a form with your personal information, you aren&#39;t being asked to send money, you don&#39;t have to even give your name... but you do feel like you are actually part of something larger. The decision to engage in political action has to happen somehow, via a concrete path of action, a set of events, or influences; Anonymous is precisely that path for many geeks.</font></p>

	As a teaching assistant for an upper-division writing class taught by Elizabeth Losh in the winter of 2011 at the University of California, San Diego (<span class=""caps"">UCSD</span>), I was part of the Twitter experiment turned Twitter exploit.<a href=""#1"" rel=""nofollow"">&lt;1&gt;</a>&nbsp; On a standard day, the class took the inevitable form of many large classes with a two-hundred plus student enrollment &ndash; a lecture.&nbsp; Over the course of the quarter, these lectures followed the broad theme of the course&rsquo;s title, &lsquo;<span class=""caps"">CAT</span> 125: Public Rhetoric and Practical Communication Online.&rsquo;&nbsp; Seeing an opportunity for a greater degree of student participation using the very social media technologies we had been critically discussing, Professor Losh invited a pedagogical&nbsp;experiment.</p>
<p>
	For thirty minutes of class one Thursday, students would be encouraged to use Twitter to generate a more organic and student-directed discussion than is customary in a large lecture setting.&nbsp; On the scheduled day, Professor Losh opened the specified #cat125 feed, reminded students of the invitation to tweet and switched to her lecture slides as she began her lecture on the topic of disability and social media.&nbsp; Thirty minutes later, with the majority of tweets pertaining to content unrelated to the lecture, the experiment ended with a tweet induced collective coughing fit.&nbsp; Immediately following, Professor Losh introduced a guest speaker in honor of Diversity Day on campus and the <a href=""http://muir.ucsd.edu/diversity-matters/diversity-conference.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">Teaching Diversity</a> conference held the same day.&nbsp; <a href=""http://communication.ucsd.edu/PeoplePages/TomHumphries.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Professor Tom Humphries</a>, Associate Director of the Education Studies at <span class=""caps"">UCSD</span> and an established scholar on language and culture among Deaf people, took the&nbsp;stage.</p>
<p>
	Given an outcome that diverged from the anticipated use of social media to engender class-related discussion, the question that immediately surfaced was did the experiment fail? The events and conversations that unfolded surrounding this pedagogical experiment actually address two interrelated but separate issues: 1) the effectiveness of a twitter-enabled backchannel in a university lecture hall and 2) the affective alignment of this backchannel with content.&nbsp; My focus in this commentary is primarily on the first and although the pedagogical value of the experiment was not that which might have been intended, something was learned in relation to each of these issues.&nbsp; The experiment did not fail.&nbsp; My response is not one characterized by a fear of technological dystopia or distraction.&nbsp; Equally, it is not one that embraces techno-futurist utopianism.&nbsp; It is above all a response that concerns the important role context has to play when incorporating networked social media into established pedagogical&nbsp;structures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>What Exactly&nbsp;Happened?</strong></p>
<p>
	In the weeks leading up to the set date, Professor Losh introduced Twitter and how to tweet to a lecture hall where everybody had heard of the micro-blogging platform, but only half knew how it functioned and even fewer had an account.&nbsp; Admittedly, even as a graduate student who specializes in a new media field, I fell into the group of non-account holders but I was excited at the prospect of the experiment.&nbsp; So, I created an account and prepared to join in on the conversation.&nbsp; On the day of the experiment, we hoped that the Twitter backchannel would allow for multi-way dialogue and/or commentary about the lecture material among those seated in the lecture hall.&nbsp; This was not the&nbsp;reality.</p>
<p>
	Once the experiment started, a handful of isolated tweets did address the topic of the lecture.&nbsp; After watching a YouTube video created by a young woman with autism<a href=""#_edn2"" name=""_ednref"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""""></a>,<a href=""#2"" rel=""nofollow"">&lt;2&gt;</a> one student wrote, &ldquo;#cat125 I have always kind of wondered what it might feel like to live inside an autistic mind, at least now I have seen it&hellip;.in some form.&rdquo;&nbsp; Others expressed discomfort with the material.&nbsp; However, most of the dialogue that occurred, that is the tweets that responded to and referenced each other, concerned topics that had no relation to the&nbsp;lecture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	One such conversation topic involved the prospect of trending in San Diego.&nbsp; A student tweeted, &ldquo;i wonder if we could actually get #cat125 to become a top trending topic. that would be ridiculously fun.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which another responded, &ldquo;clearly we aren&rsquo;t tweeting enough if we aren&rsquo;t even a top trending topic.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, @TrendsSanDiego confirmed that the tweet frequency had tipped: &ldquo;#cat125 is now trending in #SanDiego <a href=""http://trendsmap.com/us/san+diego"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trendsmap.com/us/san+diego</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The other topic of choice was the plan of a coughing uprising.&nbsp; One student, who appeared to have conversed with another over a non-Twitter channel proposed, &ldquo;#cat125 i say at 2:30 we all randomly start coughing &hellip; the proff isn&rsquo;t tweeting so she won&rsquo;t know whts going on hahaha.&rdquo;<a href=""#3"" rel=""nofollow"">&lt;3&gt;</a>&nbsp; The suggestion prompted other tweets such as, &ldquo;lezz doo itt! #cat125&rdquo; and &ldquo;#cat125 2min left guys!&nbsp; The countdownnnnnnn haha.&rdquo;&nbsp; At 2:30 the coughing began which prompted me to check the twitter feed to confirm what I suspected, that this collective action began with a tweet.&nbsp; This was the official end to the&nbsp;experiment.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Is Twitter an Effective&nbsp;Backchannel?</strong></p>
<p>
	During our regularly scheduled and far more intimate section meeting later that day, I asked a group of fifteen students what they thought of the experience, both critically and viscerally.&nbsp; Did it succeed or fail?&nbsp; A desired outcome of the experiment was to destabilize the traditional lecture dynamic.&nbsp; Using Twitter, students could have a collective voice and engage with and discuss the material on their own&nbsp;terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Yet, first words out of many of my students&rsquo; mouths were, &ldquo;She [the professor] didn&rsquo;t tell us what to do.&rdquo;&nbsp; The students wanted a defined and transparent assignment, ideally, or instructed suggestions, at the least.&nbsp; When I responded that the purpose of the experiment was precisely to break these constraints and pushed the students to further develop their opinions, the conversation quickly veered into the realm of traditional pedagogical expectations and norms.&nbsp; All but two of the fifteen students voiced that they expected some level of direction, especially in a lecture setting.&nbsp; Some even felt that such direct guidance was a necessary element of&nbsp;education.</p>
<p>
	The other point that my students brought up in our post-experiment discussion was one of distraction.&nbsp; The majority stressed that because they had to divide their attention between the twitter screen feed on their phones or laptops and the lecture material on the projection screen, they could not effectively pay attention to either.&nbsp; I confess I also felt the pull of multi-tasking between two separate screens.&nbsp; While this perceived tension may allude to a valid criticism of new technology and suggest the need for a degree of coherence when using networked media for pedagogical purposes, it is also a bit&nbsp;perplexing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Without exception, in the <span class=""caps"">CAT</span> 125 lecture hall and in every other classroom I have sat in since laptops and cell phones became regular attendees of university classes, students routinely have some communication or entertainment technology running in the background.&nbsp; The usual suspects are e-mail, Facebook, <span class=""caps"">SMS</span>, and computer games.&nbsp; Yet, the majority of them are also using their networked devices to reference the course website, look up a word or an event, and type notes as the professor talks.&nbsp; Before laptops and cell phones, it was passing notes and doodling.&nbsp; Put simply, students are good at&nbsp;multi-tasking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The twitter experiment, then, should have appealed to their incredible multi-tasking abilities. Since Twitter&rsquo;s launch in 2006, several instructors have incorporated twitter in the classroom, many with similar intentions of bolstering student participation in a lecture setting.&nbsp; Monica A. Rankin, an assistant professor of history at the University of Texas at Dallas, used twitter as a backchannel in a class of ninety students.&nbsp; Sugato Chakravarty, a professor of consumer sciences and retailing at Purdue, encourages his lecture hall of 250 students to do the same.<a href=""#_edn4"" name=""_ednref"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""""></a><a href=""#4"" rel=""nofollow"">&lt;4&gt;</a>&nbsp; Others, such as Dave Parry, an assistant professor of Emerging Media and Communications, also at the University of Texas at Dallas, have employed Twitter in smaller class sizes with success.<a href=""#5"" rel=""nofollow"">&lt;5&gt;</a><a href=""#_edn5"" name=""_ednref"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""""></a>&nbsp; So why, in this case, did the students collectively use Twitter for other&nbsp;purposes?</p>
<p>
	What ties each of these other examples together is the use of the platform on a regularly scheduled basis.&nbsp; Professors Ranking, Chakravarty and Parry all foreground Twitter as a standard component of the classroom experience and address the commentary stream during the class period.&nbsp; What we asked students to do was to experiment with Twitter on a single occasion, without any facilitation and without the presence of an authority figure.&nbsp; One might think that in a class focused on the rhetorical use of online communication, students would apply the critical analysis and use of online media modeled in lecture to their participation in the experiment.&nbsp; However, based on the two main points raised by my students, this was merely an assumption.&nbsp; It seems that as a group, the students chose to partially shed their identity as students in a classroom precisely because the request did not fit within their expectations of the roles and responsibilities teachers and students should have in a university context, in general, and a lecture class, in&nbsp;particular.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Is Twitter an Affective&nbsp;Backchannel? </strong></p>
<p>
	The key concept to take from this discussion is one of context.&nbsp; Interestingly, context is also at the center of the second issue that informs the question of the experiment&rsquo;s success.&nbsp; After the experiment officially ended, and having kept to her policy of nonintervention, Professor Losh joined the stream and asked, &ldquo;@_@ why is everyone coughing #cat125?&rdquo; to which a student replied, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what to say&hellip;#cat125 deleting account now&hellip;&rdquo;<a href=""#6"" rel=""nofollow"">&lt;6&gt;</a><a href=""#_edn6"" name=""_ednref"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""""></a></p>
<p>
	It is important here to recall that the focus of the day&rsquo;s lecture was the intersection of disability and technology.&nbsp; There is something unsettling about the perceived insensitivity of using a Twitter backchannel to organize a coughing coup given the topic being discussed at the front of the lecture hall.&nbsp; Whether the student who deleted her account in reaction to the coughing did so in relation to a disrespect for the professor, or for the subject-matter, or both is unclear.&nbsp; I can say that while my students were quick to defend their use of Twitter for non-educational ends, they were horrified when I suggested the potential way their collective actions could be interpreted.&nbsp; Of course, only about a third of the students in the lecture that day actually participated in the Twitter stream, but even in terms of initial reactions to the experiment, the students simply did not take the disconnect with the lecture content into account.&nbsp; It simply didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;register.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The fear that digital media is making us more insensitive or allowing us to live in our own self-defined reality is not what I have chosen to address here. What I can say, on the basis of exploring one particular use of Twitter in the classroom is that new networked and social media technologies offer a tremendous potential for disrupting an educational structure that often unintentially promotes passive engagement and single-direction learning.&nbsp; However, specifying and paying attention to the context in which these tools are used is a necessary step for working out the glitches from this opportunity.&nbsp; The fact that the students used Twitter in a way that, for the most part, was not related to the class and was seemingly disrespectful does not mean that the experiment failed.&nbsp; What it does mean is that as technology continues to enter the culture of pedagogy, we must take seriously where these glitches reveal we are butting up against existing walls and continue to experiment, tweak, and break these down from the inside&nbsp;out.</p>

What I can say, on the basis of exploring one particular use of Twitter in the classroom is that new networked and social media technologies offer a tremendous potential for disrupting an educational structure that often unintentially promotes passive engagement and single-direction learning.&nbsp; However, specifying and paying attention to the context in which these tools are used is a necessary step for working out the glitches from this opportunity.&nbsp; The fact that the students used Twitter in a way that, for the most part, was not related to the class and was seemingly disrespectful does not mean that the experiment failed.&nbsp; What it does mean is that as technology continues to enter the culture of pedagogy, we must take seriously where these glitches reveal we are butting up against existing walls and continue to experiment, tweak, and break these down from the inside&nbsp;out.</p>

	<font size=""3"">WikiLeaks reveals a lot about how power works, and about its transformation. But the significance is not so much in WikiLeaks is, but what it has represented, especially for people and organizations with a vested interest in how the internet works. There are two aspects to Wikileaks: there is Wikileaks as it is, and the media phenomon of its wider reception. WikiLeaks as it is, as an organization, doesn&#39;t tell us as much as what Wikileaks as a this broader phenomenon tells us. The phenomenon - including the reporting of leaks in the mass media, the backlash by American lawmakers, the media attention to the accusations against founder Julian Assange, and the escalating tactics of DDoS by Anonymous and major US corporations - tells us quite a lot about the relationship between old media and new media, especially about the importance of the &#39;exploit&#39; as a feature of new media power.</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"">
	<font size=""3""><b>Wikileaks as it is: </b></font><font size=""3""><span style=""font-weight: normal"">Before discussing how WikiLeaks became a media and cultural phenomenon of WikiLeaks, it&#39;s worth considering what exactly the original founders were hoping to achieve. When we discuss WikiLeaks, it&#39;s easy to forget that the organization itself has</span></font><font size=""3""> only a few paid staff and a small core of deeply engaged volunteers. This made the organization, at least initially, very similar to many other emergent, grassroots efforts using the internet to crowd-source content, and leveraged its global, distributed nature as a kind of fail-safe against censure in any one jurisdiction. As </font><font color=""#000080""><span lang=""zxx""><u><a href=""http://networkcultures.org/wpmu/geert/2010/08/30/ten-theses-on-wikileaks/""><font size=""3"">Lovink</font></a></u></span></font><font size=""3""> noted in a July 2010 article, such single-person organizations are a feature of contemporary mediated life. He writes:</font></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 1.25cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"">
	Like small and medium-sized businesses, the founder cannot be voted out, and, unlike many collectives, leadership does not rotate. This is not an uncommon feature within organizations, irrespective of whether they operate in the realm of politics, culture or the &ldquo;civil society&rdquo; sector. SPOs are recognizable, exciting, inspiring, and easy to feature in the media. Their sustainability, however, is largely dependent on the actions of their charismatic leader, and their functioning is difficult to reconcile with democratic values. This is also why they are difficult to replicate and do not scale up easily.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"">
	The initial goals of WikiLeaks were closely aligned with individual interests of Julian Assange, and the fortunes of the organization have also been aligned with his personality. Assange&#39;s writing, as far back as 2006, critiques <font size=""3"">strict control over information as one of the factors that made state power illegitimate. From this perspective, the hactivist aims of the early incarnations of WikiLeaks formed a natural extension of these thoughts. The premise was simple: the organization would maintain an encrypted Internet drop-box that would accept submissions of material that was of public interest but that would not otherwise be published.</font></p>
<p>
	Most small SPOs do not achieve the level of notoriety or influence of Wikileaks. What made so much difference was not Wikileaks as it is (or was) but the way that Wikileaks as a phenomenon operated within the networks of mass media and new media. Beginning with the publication of the Afghan war logs, but certainly by the time of the release of the Collateral Murder, WikiLeaks began to more consciously push leaked information to the mass media. As luck would have it, Assange convinced the Guardian newspaper (and, eventually, others) to work with them on redacting the leaked diplomatic cables. The publication of the stories based on these redacted cables, and the resulting &ndash; and continuing &ndash; media furore, constitutes what I consider the WikiLeaks phenomenon.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"">
	<b>WikiLeaks as Phenomenon: Network and New Media Power</b></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"">
	<span style=""font-weight: normal"">WikiLeaks as a phenomenon draws attention to several aspects of our highly mediated contemporary experiences. Castells (2009) argues that the major force of power at present is communication power, and he also conceives of the main model for our society as the network. Cardoso (2009) goes even further, claiming that communication taking place within a networked organizational model creates communicational paradigms that link mass media forms of communication and interpersonal forms through a globalization of communication and a greater interactivity. In this context, the WikiLeaks phenomenon includes two elements: First, the disruption of news production that resulted from the partnerships between WikiLeaks and mass media organizations; and second, the technical and legal measures taken to shut down WikiLeaks (mostly by US commercial and state actors) and the reactions mounted against these measures by individuals associating themselves with Anonymous. Overall, this phenomenon &ndash; or drama, as </span><font color=""#000080""><span lang=""zxx""><u><a href=""http://www.socialtextjournal.org/blog/2010/12/the-dramatic-face-of-wikileaks.php""><span style=""font-weight: normal"">Coleman </span></a></u></span></font><span style=""font-weight: normal"">(2010) claims &ndash; illustrates the interrelated elements of mediation, communication, and power, especially within the organizational structure of the network.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"">
	<font size=""3""><span style=""font-weight: normal"">Writing about the influence of networks on power, Alex Galloway claims that the power in a distributed network is rooted in protocol. In contrast to power in a modern, liberal formation, speaking to individual agency within a structure, protocol power deals with autonomous entities interlinked within smooth networks with some set parameters governing their connections (2004; p. 157). Because it takes a different formation than previous instatiations of power, resistance is differently configured. Instead of a resistant block, other theorists like Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri propose models of &ldquo;nomadic&rdquo; resistance, or forms of &ldquo;multitude&rdquo; where actions are not centrally coordinated but nevertheless contribute to resistance. Castells (2001) thinks of these groupings in terms of their ability to be &#39;networked organizations&#39;. In its transformation from a group of hacktivists using the opportunities of the internet to let data speak truth to power, to a phenomenon that leveraged much of the internet and impacted the production of mass media, Wikileaks illustrates the new possibilities of protocol and resistance.</span></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"">
	<span style=""font-weight: normal"">In their 2007 book </span><i><span style=""font-weight: normal"">The Exploit</span></i><span style=""font-style: normal""><span style=""font-weight: normal"">, </span></span><span style=""font-weight: normal"">Galloway and Thacker argue that the network is merely a condition of possibility for the operation of protocol, which can direct control around the network. Within the form of power that is protocol is the potential for an &#39;exploit&#39; or disruption of protocol. The exploit is a property of the system, but it is also the thing that disrupts the system. This is one thing that WikiLeaks has effectively done; by identifying the logic of control underlying both secrets and the way that secrets have in the past and may now become news</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"">
	<font size=""3"">The Wikileaks phenomenon displays a couple of exploits. First, the insertion of Wikileaks into the production of news exploited features of the journalism process, inserting a new intermediary into the process and potentially creating a kind of disruptive innovation in the production of journalistic content. This disruption is based on the permanence and reproducibility of internet data . Second, the response of Anonymous to attempts to shut down the WikiLeaks organization reiterated how the exploit is a central property of a system of protocol: despite the increasing state regulation and governance of the internet, it still to some degree operates based on principles of distributed power.</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"">
	<font size=""3""><i><b>Exploiting the news process</b></i></font></p>
<p style=""line-height: 150%"">
	WikiLeaks became significant because of its lucky ability to exploit the news production process. Through the summer of 2010, internet scholars, security specialists and hacktivists gleefully discussed the tidbits of scandal and deluges of data that WikiLeaks released.&nbsp; This ranged from Sarah Palin&rsquo;s e-mail to thousands of pages on the US involvement in Afghanistan.&nbsp; But these leaks were not effective at drawing attention to the secrets in the way that Assange may have initially intended, at least in his writings. Thus, the partnerships with news organizations became important in advancing his single purpose. It also contributed to the conflation of WikiLeaks as an organization with Assange as a character, as Anderson&#39;s piece in this collection describes in detail.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 150%"">
	The partnerships, as they expanded beyond Assange&#39;s goals, began to attract significant attention to the leaks. Whereas the leaked information about Afghanistan was so voluminous that only a few media stories broke, the diplomatic cables were redacted by journalists working with large newspapers. As Sarah Ellison&#39;s <font color=""#000080""><span lang=""zxx""><u><a href=""http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2011/02/the-guardian-201102"">Vanity Fair article</a></u></span></font> describes in wincing detail, this partnership was awkward for Assange, for the other members of WikiLeaks, and especially for the various journalists and newspapers involved.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 150%"">
	<font color=""#231f20""><font face=""Bodoni-Book, serif""><font size=""3"">We can read this unique partnership with a leaker, a non-national holder of leaks, and the conventional mass media as an exploit of the news-making process, and an innovation in reporting. As <a href=""http://zunguzungu.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/julian-assange-and-the-computer-conspiracy-%E2%80%9Cto-destroy-this-invisible-government%E2%80%9D/#"">Aaron Bady</a> notes,</font></font></font></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 1.25cm; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 150%"">
	The way most journalists &ldquo;expose&rdquo; secrets as a professional practice &mdash; to the extent that they do &mdash; is just as narrowly selfish: because they publicize privacy only when there is profit to be made in doing so, they keep their eyes on the valuable muck they are raking, and learn to pledge their future professional existence on a continuing and steady flow of it. In muck they trust.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 150%"">
	The partnership between the mass media journalists and WikiLeaks has provoked much reflection by the journalistic community. Like Ellison, many of them concentrate on the incongruity of negotiating with Assange, who often threatened to release underrated diplomatic cables if the process did not go as smoothly as he had hoped. This was exacerbated by the media attention and legal threats placed on Assange himself. However, what these reports have in common is description of a shifting role for the journalist: not necessarily collecting breaking news, but instead working to validate and contextualize raw data that has come from another source. In this way, WikiLeaks has exploited the network of news production and transformed it.<font color=""#231f20""><font face=""Bodoni-Book, serif""><font size=""3""> Using the capacity of the internet to easily reproduce and maintain identical data, ithas created a unique and persistent digital repository for the type of information which in the past would have been provided to journalists by trusted sources. </font></font></font></p>
<p style=""line-height: 150%"">
	<font color=""#231f20""><font face=""Bodoni-Book, serif""><font size=""3"">With the complicity of newsrooms, WikiLeaks has created a significant new innovation in the way that international news is investigated and released. It has succeeded in having previously unavailable material put out in to the public domain. But it has not done this by maintaining a &#39;people power&#39; wiki with every leak freely available. It has instead, through a combination of luck and strategy, added an innovation to the function of newsrooms strained by budget cuts. The publication of stories based on leaked cables continues even now, with a string of revelations appearing this week in India&#39;s national newspapers.</font></font></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"">
	<font size=""3""><i><b>Exploiting the Internet</b></i></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"">
	<font size=""3"">The WikiLeaks phenomenon also introduced a second exploit. This one was the not the result of any actions of Assange or WikiLeaks volunteers. It was the outcome of a perception by individual internet users that powerful government and corporate interests shouldn&#39;t use technical tools to shut down Wikileaks without some retaliation &ndash; of the same type, of course.</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"">
	<font size=""3"">After the release of the diplomatic cables, Wikileaks experienced censure by the US government, as well as the suspension of its bank accounts. Yochai Benkler describes the events </font><font face=""TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif""><font size=""3"">this way in a February 2011 </font></font><font color=""#000080""><span lang=""zxx""><u><a href=""http://www.benkler.org/Benkler%20Wikileaks%20CRCL%20Working%20Paper%20Feb_8.pdf""><font face=""TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif""><font size=""3"">working paper</font></font></a></u></span></font><font face=""TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif""><font size=""3"">: </font></font></p>

	&ldquo;<font face=""TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif""><font size=""3"">Responding to a call from Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman, several commercial organization tried to shut down Wikileaks by denial of service of the basic systems under their respective control. Wikileaks&#39; domain name server provider stopped pointing at the domain &ldquo;wikileaks.org,&rdquo; trying to make it unreachable. Amazon, whose cloud computing platform was hosting the data, cut off hosting services for the site. Banks and payment companies, like Mastercard, Visa, and PayPal, as well as the Swiss postal bank, cut off payment service to Wikileaks in an effort to put pressure on the site&#39;s ability to raise money from supporters around the world. It is hard to identify the extent to which direct government pressure, beyond the public appeals for these actions and their subsequent praise from Senator Joe Liberman, was responsible for these actions.&rdquo;</font></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%"">
	<font face=""TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif""><font size=""3"">This government pressure, although it was coupled with pressure from the US companies was not centrally coordinated. Instead, it took the form of an &#39;integrated, cross-system attack&rdquo; in Benkler&#39;s terms. In response, another exploit took place. Individuals aligning themselves with online group identity Anonymous staged DDoS counter-attacks, succeeding in shutting down MasterCard and Paypay&#39;swebsites temporarily.

He considered the actions of Anonymous to be a kind of direct action against internet censorship, which is separate from the role of WikiLeaks as a whistle-blower with ties to non-governmental organizations and the mass media. In particular, the use of distributed denial of service attacks, which flood web sites with requests, is inconvenient from a technical point of view and requires resources to mitigate, but which is not inherently damaging. Following these retaliatory actions, thousands of individuals set up mirror sites of all of the wikileaks.org content, defeating the purpose of cutting off access to the site. Both of these activities were undertaken not by action coordinated far in advance, but by thousands of individuals who could be mobilized quickly to act in the support of a shared principle</span></font></font></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; line-height: 150%"">
	<font color=""#231f20""><font face=""Bodoni-Book, serif""><font size=""3"">The response from Anonymous and other internet users is a reminder that the Internet is not structured the way a broadcaster is. It can be &#39;killed&#39; in one country, but for the moment it remains a set of interlinked distributed networks, where data that can cheaply and easily be reproduced can be maintained for long periods of time, across national borders. Exploits of these networks don&#39;t only come from powerful actors. They can come from individuals and collectives, and may indicate a new role for the multitude. </font></font></font></p>

<p style=""line-height: 150%"">
	<font color=""#231f20""><font face=""Bodoni-Book, serif""><font size=""3"">What these two exploits visible within the WikiLeaks phenomenon demonstrate, is that the logic of contemporary media power is not one of blocks of massive resistance to centralized power. Nor is it only a matter of hactivist projects were decentralized networks route around centralized control. New media power, as we have seen in these examples, operates on distributed networks. These have their own logic of control, which create the opportunity for an &ldquo;exploit&rdquo; or disruption from within. In 2007 Galloway and Thacker wrote:</font></font></font></p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"" style=""margin-left: 1.25cm; border: none; padding: 0cm; font-weight: normal; line-height: 150%"">
	<font color=""#231f20""><font face=""Bodoni-Book, serif""><font size=""3"">To be effective, future political movements must discover a new exploit. A whole new topology of resistance must be invented that is as asymmetrical in relationship to networks as the network was in relation to power centres. . . .The new exploit will be an &lsquo;anti-web&rsquo; (2007, p. 22)</font></font></font></p>

	<font color=""#231f20""><font face=""Bodoni-Book, serif""><font size=""3"">WikiLeaks reveals that the logic of networked power can be anti-web. It is not making an alternative to the production of mass media. It is innovating upon it. Similarly, it is not demonstrating that the Internet is a brave new world with a new logic unlike that of conventional hierarchy: instead it is demonstrating that corporate, activist, and governmental interests all use overlapping strategies to exploit the organizational and power structures provided by the internet.</font></font></font></p>

	<strong>Henry James on Twitter: or, the crisis in attention as production of interiority</strong></p>

<p>
	In the midst of the recent uproar over &ldquo;distracted minds&rdquo; and Twitterized attention-spans, it might be worthwhile to remember the last moment when 140-character communications became all the rage&mdash;and the response of one of our famously voluble novelists to the new technologies of distraction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	At the opening of Henry James&rsquo;s short story &ldquo;<a href=""http://www2.newpaltz.edu/~hathawar/inthcage.html"">In the Cage</a>,&rdquo; written in 1898 and revised ten years later, our heroine is in the midst of a scene we may find strangely familiar:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:27.0pt;"">
	&ldquo;It had occurred to her early that in her position-- that of a young person spending, in framed and wired confinement, the life of a guinea-pig or a magpie-- she should know a great many persons without their recognising the acquaintance. &hellip; Her function was to sit there with two young men--the other telegraphist and the counter-clerk; to mind the &quot;sounder,&quot; which was always going, to dole out stamps and postal-orders, weigh letters, answer stupid questions, give difficult change and, more than anything else, count words as numberless as the sands of the sea, the words of the telegrams thrust, from morning to night, through the gap left in the high lattice, across the encumbered shelf that her forearm ached with rubbing. &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	What James finds interesting in this scene, the source of one of his best short tales, is precisely the new varieties of <em>attention </em>that arise in the context of a new media technology: a technology paid for by the word, with a span not much longer than a tweet. &nbsp;James was fascinated by the position of the unnamed young telegraphist, who resides at the margin of the public and the private, able to covertly partake in the private dramas of telegraphs through her very public role as a part of the communication machine.&nbsp; Like the author himself, and like many bloggers and tweeters today, she is an intensely private figure given over to an immensely public occupation. Ostensibly condemned to merely count, transcribe, and monetize &ldquo;words as numberless as the sands of the sea,&rdquo; she instead acts as a covert reader, interpreter, and then actor within the private scenes limned by the terse telegraphic communications which roll across her desk: &ldquo;Everard, Hotel Brighton, Paris. Only understand and believe. 22d to 26th, and certainly 8th and 9th. Perhaps others. Come. Mary.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Innumerable jeremiads on the dangers of distraction in the age of iReading warn us of danger to human attention, as well as the values prized by the humanities, in the move to ever more novel forms of media and mediated attention.&nbsp; James&rsquo;s more than century-old treatment of the young telegraphist of &ldquo;In the Cage,&rdquo; and her resourcefulness in the face of constant and interminable distraction, should remind today&rsquo;s teachers and writers of the lingering forms of <em>attentiveness</em> that (still) matter during moments of changing technologies of attention and distraction, calling us to reconsider our own attitudes towards &ldquo;disruptive&rdquo; social technology.</p>
<p>
	1. First, disruptive stimuli can paradoxically cultivate the ability to select and to sympathize.&nbsp; What James Gleick recently called the &ldquo;Information Flood&rdquo; has its most important predecessors in the experience of the great metropoles, particularly what Georg Simmel analyzed as the effect of constant stimuli on metropolitan mental life.&nbsp; In Simmel&rsquo;s description, the individual&rsquo;s experience of the metropolitan world becomes dampened and &ldquo;habituated&rdquo; to constant change&mdash;<em>blas&eacute;, </em>to use his key term&mdash;while the inner life and its expression becomes paradoxically heightened: &ldquo;&hellip;in order that this most personal element be saved, extremities and peculiarities and individualizations must be produced and they must be over-exaggerated merely to be brought into the awareness even of the individual himself.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref"" title="""">[1]</a> James describes the effect of the information flood on his young heroine in terms remarkably similar to Simmel&rsquo;s essay of 1903: &ldquo;The girl was <em>blas&eacute;e; </em>nothing could belong more, as she perfectly knew, to the intense publicity of her profession; but she had a whimsical mind and wonderful nerves; she was subject, in short, to sudden flickers of antipathy and sympathy, red gleams in the grey, fitful needs to notice and to &lsquo;care,&rsquo; odd caprices of curiosity&rdquo; (&ldquo;New York Edition,&rdquo; 1908, vol.11: 371).&nbsp; Despite research showing a decline in empathy among some heavy users of social media, and despite worries over our <em>blas&eacute;</em> students, we should be reminded here of the selectivity of attention that most users of such media exhibit: constant stimuli can make one paradoxically more attentive to the &ldquo;signals&rdquo; that actually matter.</p>
<p>
	2. But what <em>matters </em>to the protagonist of James&rsquo;s story?&nbsp; Social standing, romance, and class, as it turns out in the course of the narrative, perhaps not quite in that order.&nbsp; The telegrams give her, in careless splashes of &ldquo;shillings and pence&rdquo; that would have fed her family for a week, a vision of the &ldquo;high reality&rdquo; of the gentleman and ladies of a London society closed to her&mdash;except, however, for the crucial fact of her own imaginative capacity.&nbsp; With that and the aid of her ha&rsquo;penny novels, she can recreate all the romances, the happinesses, and the tragedies of the upper classes&mdash;and forget the mundane fact of her own encroaching marriage to &ldquo;Mr. Mudge,&rdquo; the grocer.&nbsp; We can clearly see here an antecedent to such media as the Twitter celebrity feed or the tabloid weekly; we should note, however, that the relationship of the young girl to the imagined &ldquo;high reality&rdquo; she imagines for &ldquo;Mary&rdquo; and Captain Everard remains ambivalent&mdash;at times disgusted and at times enthralled&mdash;delighting in their tragedies as well as their romances.&nbsp; Her relationship to what she takes as a &ldquo;high reality&rdquo; is considerably more complex than that of simple ideological delusion.&nbsp; &nbsp;As the Charlie Sheen #Winning affair shows, this mix of fascination, <em>Schadenfreude</em>, and strategic aversion lies close at hand in our contemporary obsessions with &ldquo;society life&rdquo; and its perils.</p>
<p>
	3. Finally and crucially, the young telegraphist becomes an agent in the story she tracks. &nbsp;Through careful reading, small clues, and a quick intervention, she comes to play a role in the romance between &ldquo;Mary&rdquo; and Captain Everard, one where she feels herself to be briefly the equal of her &ldquo;customers,&rdquo; even perhaps holding their fate in her hands.&nbsp; The movement between an imagined vision of their &ldquo;society life&rdquo; elsewhere and the narrative of her own inner life coincide, at least for a moment.&nbsp; As with our own disruptive social technologies, the telegraph finally becomes an instrument for self-invention, opening entirely new&nbsp;areas of action and expression.&nbsp; As James also shows us, the intervention is only for a moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end the telegraphist returns to her class location, and her planned marriage to a grocer, entirely of her own will: economic determinations remain determinative.&nbsp; The difference to her inner life, however, as James uses his most painstaking techniques to show us, remains incalculable.</p>
<p>
	As we conclude this cluster on the &ldquo;Distraction Span&rdquo; in the new everyday, James&rsquo;s analog fable offers us a still point of rest, where we might take the measure of our students&rsquo; and our own digital distraction.&nbsp; Are we imaginatively and pedagogically enabled by new technological distractions, given the tools to connect across continents and class lines (in both senses), enabled to form new imagined communities and perhaps renewed inner lives, as @Asher Danziger and @Lauren Berliner seem to suggest?&nbsp; Indeed, as @Gina Lamb demonstrates, social media tools could save the inner lives <em>and </em>physical lives of those subsisting on the fringes of the &ldquo;everyday,&rdquo; like the dangerously exposed LGBT youth she describes. &nbsp;In the majority case, however, we still must ask: are we and our students fated to return from our dalliances with the virtual, like the young telegraphist of James&rsquo;s story, to Mr. Mudge the grocer and economic necessity, and to the &ldquo;framed and wired confinement&rdquo; of a digital life &ldquo;in the cage,&rdquo; attenuated and numbed by constant distraction?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	@Elizabeth Losh&rsquo;s fascinating entries on an experiment with Twitter in the lecture classroom, along with @Quinlan Adley&rsquo;s bleak view of Facebook pathology, reminds us of the dangers as well as the possibilities of social media in educational contexts, and raises some disturbing questions about the potential for new media to obscure communicative context and empathetic response.&nbsp; @Sara Harris, along with Losh and @Tara Zepel, addresses what seems to me the crucial question of the teacher&rsquo;s role in modeling and focusing attention in any context, analog or digital, as does their students&rsquo; central question: &ldquo;what is the assignment?&rdquo;&nbsp; The problem with being &ldquo;one of those people on whom nothing is lost,&rdquo; as Henry James described his own writerly state of distraction, is that one must then also have a sense of what matters, and why.&nbsp; Attentive pedagogy in the new media landscape, then, cannot do without a concept of the good life, of worthwhile political goals, of the final ends of education for the individual and the community, and of necessary critical analysis, even as we remain attentive to the generation of new forms of communal and inner life in a new age of distraction.</p>

Why does the &ldquo;media spotlight&rdquo; paradigm continue to hold sway in a journalistic world so radically different than the one Gitlin chronicled in the 1980&rsquo;s? After all, Wikileaks is itself a media organization; why should it be so dependent on the celebrity-inclined tendencies of the traditional press? After all, the much of the impetus behind the call to &ldquo;</font></a><font face=""arial, helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2""><a _fcksavedurl=""http://www.alternet.org/media/23741"" href=""http://www.alternet.org/media/23741"" style=""color: rgb(25, 97, 149); text-decoration: none; "" target=""_blank"">be the media</a>&rdquo; in the early days of the digital revolution stemmed from a desire to escape the very trap Gitlin chronicled in the Whole World is Watching. While much of the analysis of the continued importance of the traditional press is often framed in terms of&nbsp;the fact that it contributes the most original reporting and shoe-leather journalism, we shouldn&rsquo;t forget that there are other reasons for the success of the mainstream media as well. One of them is the manner in which it taps into a deep desire on the part of news consumers to be entertained, to bask in the sun of celebrity. It may be that the &ldquo;scientific journalism&rdquo; of Wikileaks and similar groups is too bloodless to ever obviate the need for the creation of dramatic stories with outsized personalities and colorful characters.</font></span></p>

	One of the governing fears of academic life&mdash;and one of the governing assumptions of administrative policy&mdash;is that &#39;the public,&#39; variously defined, would not particularly mind if the humanities disappeared. The attendant politics, which Raymond Williams once called &ldquo;adolescent,&rdquo; is that the administration of our common life is a wasteland of special interests and squandered energies, which can only corrupt the pure work of writing and research.</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	Here, I argue that the crisis of the humanities is not a crisis of public relations, but of administered dispossession. Academics should know that the terms of the fight are more vital and complex than the banal realpolitik of competing media strategies. Following the budget cuts in New York state&mdash;which affected five programs and departments in the humanities&mdash;public commentary either forcefully protested the decision or lamented its sad necessity. There has been no shortage of public sympathy for the state of the humanities: the long decline of what Jeffrey Williams has called the &ldquo;welfare state university&rdquo; has always been a shame, and no one, it seems, is prepared to argue otherwise.</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	The problem is less the perceived value of the humanities than the economic processes which determine the social space in which it exists. These processes are, increasingly, those of dispossession and devaluation: on the one hand, we have the elimination of departments; on the other hand, we have the rise of the adjuncts, the transient, indebted, semi-employed and scarcely unionized laborers who constitute the majority of instructors in higher education in the United States today. The current defunding of the SUNY system is but one instance in this long trajectory. Such crises are not new, nor are they limited to public higher education: for more than a generation, life in New York State is life interrupted. The widespread awareness of this potential trauma colors the lives of New Yorkers; it is fundamental to the culture and will form the core of any political movement to come.</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	Precarious lives are lives on the brink of outrage. But the political issue is never just the outrage, but its organized expression. Similarly, for the agents of dispossession, our focus should not be on ideology or personality, but the social groups for whom dispossession is a boon. To find such groups, I wish to consider two locally produced videos. In one, we have the spectacular outrage of students and workers; in the other, the calm and banal competence of a technocratic administrator. These videos suggest that mass media representation is not the horizon of politics, but one of its constitutive elements. They also suggest that politics is not, as is often assumed, a matter of news cycles and rival propaganda, but a dialectic of organizational structure and lived experience, energized by movements, classes, and groups.</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	First, let me turn to an extended interview by Albany Student Television with University at Albany President Philip. The immediate curiosity of this long interview is that Philip bothered to participate at all: the dry, scarcely viewed exchange is difficult to locate, and was not picked up other media. It is evidence less of Philip&#39;s desire to open himself to public critique, than his insistence on performing his technocratic expertise. This, it turns out, is the ideal forum for such a performance: the professionalism of the young reporter, coupled with the unusual, barely edited length of the exchange, allows Philip to present the scope of his expertise. Philip appears beyond the spectacle, in an adult world of difficult choices and No Easy Answers. This is, then, a calculated effort to appear as unspectacular as possible. Philip goes to the media to perform the absence of mediation: here, we see, is the man, unfiltered, passionately objective, desperately rational, a good person in a sticky situation.</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	Philip emphasizes his own determination; and he is not wrong to do so. As Bourdieu has taught us, an administrator like Philip, as an agent within an institution, is both structured and structuring: as the recognized president of a public university, there is only so much he can be expected to think, and only so many choices he can be expected to make. At the same time, it would be a tragedy&mdash;and a profound misunderstanding&mdash;if such agents of transformation were excused as responsible adults, completing the necessary work of prudent dispossession. The decision is both personal and impersonal, as are its effects; and culpability must be located in Philip himself, as well as the structure Philip is battling to reproduce.</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	One shuttles, then, from subject to structure, to locate the forces gathered behind the decision, and the forces gathering in response. The clip suggests that Philip is the victim of circumstance, a man bound by the limits of his time. But Philip is far from an objective mediator: he is not merely the president of the university, but the representative of a bloc within that university, with particular aims and beliefs about both education and government. The introduction of &#39;enterprise&#39; into the public university is not a bulwark in a time of crisis, but an attempt to actively re-design what constitutes the work of teaching and research. The de-funding we are witnessing is not an event&mdash;nor an aftershock, nor the inevitable swing of the political pendulum&mdash;but a process of profound redistribution and socio-economic transformation. Regardless of whether he acknowledges the charge, President Philip is an agent of such changes, and a representative of the group for whom such changes are made.</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	The important point, however, is that Philip&#39;s technocratic assurance is a strategy against outrage, and should be taken as proof that such outrage is effective. Our second clip gives us this outrage in the apparent spontaneity of protest. Opening with the dances and cheers of students, and punctuated with chanting, the video suggests both anger and discipline: the lines of chanters snaking through the food-court, the protestors occupying the administration buildings, and the speeches of student leaders each suggest the slow construction of a movement. Here, behind the excitement, is the backdrop of long meetings and plans, the banal work of administering a resistance.</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	To legitimize their passion, the protestors must give the appearance of structure; to humanize his structure, Philip must give the appearance of passion. Just as the protestors emphasize their organization, President Philip iterates his deeply felt regret. In both videos, the concern for the public is salutary: the video by Save Our SUNY has been viewed less than two dozen times; the interview with Philip is buried in the institution&#39;s website, in the archives of the Students&#39; Association. This is not evidence of a failed media strategy; rather, it is evidence that propaganda does not constitute the horizon of this fight. What matters, instead, is the mobilization of groups. For the protestors, the task is to argue that every student is willing to rise and join the organization, which might then threaten not only President Philip but the legislature as a whole. For Philip, the task is to present a front of passionate but disinterested competence, in order to dissolve the anger of those affected, and to neutralize the forces gathering in response.</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	Politics remains a dialectic of lived experience&mdash;here, outrage&mdash;and the work of organization, while historical change remains the activity of contesting groups. To assume the permanence of structures, the idiocy of a manipulated public, or the passivity of the labor force is to misunderstand the processes of historical change. From faculty, responses to the cuts often oscillate between an absurd voluntarism and a vulgar fatalism, either provocative calls for radical re-imagination, or lamentations on a changing world. As we learn from CLR James, &ldquo;as so often, the truth does not lie in between&rdquo; (x). The conditions, as always, are not of one&#39;s choosing; and general resistance cannot be willed into being. But we do know that the process of transformation produces outrage: this is where the efforts of organization will begin.</p>

	The university is not an island in a sea of economism, nor an ivory tower above the general political soot; but neither is it a factory or a business. The politics of the university is the politics of a disappearing inheritance, undoubtedly the common experience of our moment. This, then, is the familiar suggestion with which I will close: to reintroduce class, less as a category of identity, than a statement of historical trajectory. Once again, two groups appear: those for whom life is rapidly improving, and the majority, for whom life getting relatively worse. Class always referred to both an identity and a trajectory: a recognized position within a structure, and a place in that structure&#39;s rocky reproduction. Class remains the fundamental category with which to pierce Philip&#39;s economism, and it clarifies the stakes in the gathering outrage, where work figures less than the production of non-work, and the production of value figures less than the distribution of misery and waste.</p>",NULL,"Unpublished",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

	There are two points with which we must start. First, Public Higher Education is under attack and must be defended. &nbsp;Second,&nbsp; the study of both Gender and Women&rsquo;s issues carried out in Women&rsquo;s Studies classrooms has immense significance for our world&mdash;a world in which domination faces our students in ever more complicated, violent, and subtle forms&mdash;and for continuing to develop more ethical and politically engaged forms of academic inquiry within the institutions where we work and study. In short Women&rsquo;s studies are of vital importance and when threatened must also be defended.</p>
<p>
	To get ahead of myself a bit, I want to discuss the ways in which these two principles can fit together, the ways in which they may or may not threaten one another, the issue of whether one rests on the other: in effect the question of the ways in which the University needs Women&rsquo;s Studies and Women&rsquo;s Studies needs the University.&nbsp; To those familiar with the debates it is a question of <em>institutionalization</em>.</p>
<p>
	In what follows I will be pursuing the problem of horizons in a time of crisis. I have found it necessary to unpack and synthesize a long and complex history surrounding the University in order to place the present &lsquo;crisis&rsquo; in a longer frame. What I would like to suggest is that the inauguration of the current crisis is roughly simultaneous with the emergence of Women&rsquo;s Studies within the University. The benefit of a historical perspective is that it unearths some of the great contributions Women&rsquo;s Studies can make towards understanding our present moment and also shows that feminist scholars have for a long time been forced (or free enough) to ask the crucial institutional questions that the crisis places in front of us today.</p>
<p>
	The 1970s are significant in three ways: this is the moment when the first WS programs are established (Buffalo 1970), it also marks the beginning of the end of the Golden Era of the American university, and it is a clear beginning point in the economic and political movement most commonly identified today as neo-liberalism. The 1970s are in these terms somewhat contradictory. The emergence of Women&rsquo;s Studies is a product of decade&rsquo;s worth of political activism around gender issues inside and outside of the university and is in ways made possible by the relative abundance of Golden Era federal funding which made the creation of new centers, programs, departments, and positions much easier than today.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;At the same time Women&rsquo;s Studies also marked the clear beginning of a critique which made clear that the traditional forms and history of intellectual work were outdated, oftentimes biased, and in need of serious transformation. One of the ways the historical ironies can be made intelligible is focusing on the role the notion of research played in the funding of the Golden Era University. The Golden Era initially solidified the autonomy of disciplines and the funding of universities by stressing the economic and political advantages of the production of knowledge under the research model.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;But by the mid 1970s all of this changed: not only were various methodologies and theories challenging ideas like disinterest and scientific research, but they also undermined academic hallmarks like <em>disciplines</em>. Above and beyond this another set of forces was at work not to undermine the internal organization of the institution but to undermine the institution itself: enter neo liberalism. David Harvey helps us to contextualize the shift from the Golden Era into the neo-liberal age we now inhabit:&nbsp; &ldquo;during the high growth years of the 1950s and 1960s [.] redistributive politics, controls over the free mobility of capital, public expenditures and welfare state building had gone hand in hand with relatively high rates of capital accumulation and adequate profitability in most of the advanced capitalist countries. But by the end of the 1960s this began to break down, both internationally and within domestic economies&rdquo; (Harvey 14).</p>
<p>
	Neo-liberalism set its sights on the well endowed public goods of the US Welfare State&mdash;such as the University--as new sites for capital accumulation. Clearly I am glossing this for the sake of brevity but there is a wealth of material being produced on Neo-Liberalism effects and functions today. What is most important to recognize is that Neo-Liberalism set a number of material limits on a certain kind of horizon which was dominant in the 1970s and is still frighteningly prevalent today: the university of the early 1960s.</p>
<p>
	This is all put forward to give a sense of the context in which debates about the institutionalization of Women&rsquo;s Studies take place. It is not just&mdash;to borrow Kathleen M. Blee&rsquo;s characterization&mdash;that &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s Studies, as a paradigm of intellectual inquiry and as an institutional site in the academy, has a complex and unstable relationship to traditional scholarly disciplines&rdquo; (177) but also that Women&rsquo;s Studies entrance into the American University loosely coincides with the dangerous instability of the University itself. So while it is clearly the case as Blee says that &ldquo;challenges to disciplinary knowledge, inherent in the intellectual mission of Women&rsquo;s Studies, have had institutional consequences for Women&rsquo;s Studies programs and departments&rdquo; (179), it seems to me quite dangerous not to be crystal clear about the economic and material forces at work.</p>
<p>
	Of equal danger is losing sight of either side of the coin: the content&mdash;if it can be called that&mdash;of Women&rsquo;s Studies is as important as the institutional form in which that content takes place. The logic is quite twisty: how can a program that questions and undermines the traditional forms of intellectual discourse take shape and appear in the academy? Is the traditional intuitional form a requisite for appearance? Finally what are the <em>costs</em>&mdash;both material and intellectual&mdash;of such an appearance?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Diane Elam addresses quite directly the fiscal and material dimension of the debate: &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s Studies is often viewed by the fiscal powers that be as a &lsquo;borrowed-time&rsquo; discipline, where specialists are constantly trying to find time to teach, study, and do research in Women&rsquo;s Studies in addition to the responsibilities they have to primary field of research. Nice work if you can get it&rdquo; (218). Elam&rsquo;s work calls attention to the fact that most scholars who teach courses in Women&rsquo;s Studies hold joint or full time appointments&mdash;if they have full time employment at all&mdash;in other departments, in other disciplines. For Elam this is a problem which discordantly strikes on two keys: not only does it place Women&rsquo;s Studies in a compromised position in the &ldquo;corporate university whose motivating principles are increased profitability,&rdquo; but it also guarantees that the intellectual work of Women&rsquo;s Studies will always stay on the backburner (219).</p>
<p>
	Now all of Elam&rsquo;s assertions rest on a knowingly provocative commitment to the <em>department </em>in its traditional form as horizon. I am not so much bothered or concerned with Elam&rsquo;s hard earned pragmatism in the face of the crisis as I am with the theoretical principles evident when she writes: &ldquo;The important move that Women&rsquo;s Studies can make is that it can indeed become a department without simultaneously taking on the rigidity of a discipline. In doing this it can begin to challenge the terms and conditions under which the university is used to operating. Part of the negotiation that Women&rsquo;s Studies as a department will have to make is preserving, even intensifying, all of its various interdisciplinary connections while arguing for its fiscal, administrative, and disciplinary autonomy&rdquo; (220).</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;Here the historical lens helps us to see that disciplinary autonomy is not only directly connected to a model of knowledge production (research) but that <em>being a department</em> only guarantees autonomy under a set of larger conditions. So while departmental autonomy for a department like English in the Golden Era translated into heaps of books, grants, and an abundance of classes and jobs, departmental status under Neo-Liberalism means flexibility and adjuncts, an impossible tenure process, and ethically questionable public-private partnerships.&nbsp; Elam&rsquo;s confidence that &ldquo;to be a department is to be ensured, in these volatile fiscal times, that the university is committed to the acquisition of knowledge&rsquo;s about women&rdquo; (223) disregards quite explicitly the ideological edge of the question: what are the conditions for that acquisition and once acquired how is that knowledge distributed, reproduced and used?</p>
<p>
	On the institutional questions Robyn R. Warhol couldn&rsquo;t be farther from Elam. Warhol does not see security in the traditional formations whatsoever, going as far as saying that if her program were offered tenure lines she would simply turn them down. At the heart of this position is an awareness of certain kind of shift in the humanities and social sciences: &ldquo;departments in all the disciplines are gradually becoming less traditional as their tenure-track personnel are becoming more interdisciplinary&rdquo;. Warhol sees that interdisciplinarity which was once quite unique to Women&rsquo;s Studies programs is now becoming a wider trend. This leads Warhol to suggest that &ldquo;long-term radical transformation of &lsquo;traditional departments&rsquo; is as worthy a goal as the more obviously exciting project of developing Women&rsquo;s Studies tenure lines in those institutions where it is possible&rdquo; (225). The horizon for Warhol is &ldquo;eventually dissolving the department structure of higher education in favor of a fully interdisciplinary organization for the production of knowledge&rdquo; (226).</p>
<p>
	Warhol&rsquo;s proposal is the more radical of the two positions, but it is not without its blind-spots. For instance, what are the real-world consequences for the labor practice of interdisciplinary scholars today? Is it not true that to receive rigorous interdisciplinary training it takes more time, a larger share of scarce resources, more specialists, and more administrators willing to depart from the quantitative habits of review that leave so many in the humanities and social sciences out in the cold? Warhol leaves us with these questions unanswered.</p>
<p>
	It is unsurprising&mdash;and a little cheap of me&mdash;to suggest that the prudent and powerful position lies somewhere between the two proposals, but from my local and limited position that is what I am comfortable saying. To zoom out a little bit, I want to suggest that those of us who are outside of Women&rsquo;s Studies programs can learn immensely about the coming challenges by attending to the debates and struggles surrounding institutionalization and Women&rsquo;s Studies. Furthermore, Women&rsquo;s Studies because of its long experience with the imaginative, the once un-imaginable and impossible, and its unique point of emergence in our institutional history, has much to teach us about finding the right horizons in this crisis. In short the time for disciplinary strife has passed, defending Public Higher Education and furthering the institutional progress of Women&rsquo;s Studies are contiguous elements in a single struggle.&nbsp;</p>

	The Public University as an institution and ideal has experienced significant transformations under neoliberal capitalism. Etzkowitz et al. note the emergence of what they call the &ldquo;entrepreneurial university&rdquo; or the incorporation of market ideals in the university mission as a global phenomenon.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a> Rizvi explains that privatization has restructured how the public university is governed.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a> Preist, Jacobs, and Boon point out that the auxiliary corporation plays an increasingly significant role in public university contracting.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a> At the University at Albany, University Auxiliary Services (UAS) was established to handle external contracting with food service, bookstore, and other providers. UAS is a site where University staff, faculty and students actively engage with corporations and have incorporated some market tenants into the governance structure. The University Auxiliary Service Corporation can also be understood as an institution established to function partly outside of the public and to be more flexible for market engagement thus helping to facilitate the privatization of the public. I plan to explore the implications of this restructuring by looking at how UAS has historically engaged with the unionization efforts of campus food service workers. Attention to the relationship between institutions (public and private) and labor will guide my examination of how the University Auxiliary Service Corporation (a quasi-state organization) and subcontracted food service corporations interact with campus food service workers. UAS has occupied a spectrum of positions vis-&agrave;-vis workers and private interests, but consistently attempts to locate workers outside the University.</p>

	<em>Labor and the University: Connecting International and U.S. Trends to Campus Food Service</em></p>
<p>

<p>
	Aihwa Ong defines neoliberalism as &ldquo;mobile calculative techniques of governing that can be decontextualized from their original sources and recontextualized in constellations of mutually constitutive and contingent relationships.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""">[4]</a> Ong&rsquo;s definition of neoliberalism allows for a localized analysis of a global trend because it frames neoliberalism as a set of techniques linked to new modes of governmentality, not a specific culture or structure that is easily definable or homogenously applied across various geographies. Ong also draws attention to the relationship between neoliberalism and exception arguing that exceptions to neoliberal techniques can be employed to both include and exclude specific peoples. She uses migrant workers, refugees, and trafficked peoples as an example of excluded populations who are denied citizenship or other rights. She argues that, &ldquo;in these situations of humanitarian crisis, legal citizenship is merely one of multiple schemes for (re)ordering and (re)evaluating humanity.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title="""">[5]</a> In a U.S. context, citizenship is one mechanism through which exclusion of specific populations takes place.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Within the U.S., food supply and food service work is dominated by immigrant labor. About 60% of farmworkers in the United States are undocumented or about 6 in 10.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"" title="""">[6]</a>&nbsp; Although technically contracted work, the contracts farmworkers engage in tend to be highly exploitative. In a report compiled by the <em>Southern Poverty Law Center</em>, one Latino immigrant working on a tomato farm in Florida reported making 45 cents per 32-pound bucket of tomatoes with no sick or vacation days, no health insurance, and daily exposure to pesticides. Inherent in the various forms of contractual exclusion (i.e. subcontracting agreements, flexible labor positions, piece work, or under the table work) is a fundamental devaluing of labor. Frequently, subcategories of &lsquo;official&rsquo; labor positions are created to skirt state or federal labor laws. Underlying the contractual exclusion of immigrant workers is an unwillingness to recognize individuals as full citizens subject to all the rights and entitlements of citizenship.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	As of November 2010, there were 443 food service workers at University at Albany.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"" title="""">[7]</a> Overall, there are 295 union workers, 100 student workers, and 48 managers. Over sixty percent of workers are currently unionized.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn8"" name=""_ftnref8"" title="""">[8]</a> Most of Chartwells&rsquo; staff (86%) works in the dining halls and the Campus Center; 55% work in State, Indian, Alumni, Colonial and Dutch quads and 31% work in the Campus Center.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn9"" name=""_ftnref9"" title="""">[9]</a> The remainder of Chartwells staff (14%) work in other locations including Administration, the Downtown campus, Nano Caf&eacute;, and Catering. According to the Human Resources Office at University at Albany, there are currently an estimated 4,400 employees at the University at Albany which includes the Research Foundation and Graduate Assistants.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn10"" name=""_ftnref10"" title="""">[10]</a> If campus food service workers were included in the University workforce, they would comprise 10% of University employees meaning they are a significant and potentially powerful block. The exclusion of campus food service workers from official recognition denies them access to University boards, councils, and committees.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	While there are notable risks in making the comparison between citizenship of a nation-state and membership to a campus community, there are logical parallels that can be drawn between global and national trends that have attempted to locate certain groups of laborers outside the nation-state by excluding them from citizenship rights and a trend at the University at Albany to locate campus food service workers outside the University by excluding them from the campus workforce. It is beyond the scope of this paper to explore the historical roots of nation-state formation or conceptions of citizenship, but common in both locations is the fact that specific types of membership have undergone significant transformations under neoliberal capitalism. Also, that these transformations have included a reordering of rights and entitlements in order to extract cheaper labor from vulnerable workers.</p>

	<em>I. Campus Food Service Workers under the Faculty Student Association (FSA) and University Auxiliary Services (UAS) Management</em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Auxiliary service corporations exist at a number of colleges and universities SUNY-wide. There is a SUNY Auxiliary Services Association (SASA) that meets annually and includes members from over 30 campuses, as well as members from the Research Foundation and Systems Administration. The SASA website gives a brief history of the rise of auxiliary service corporations (ASCs) within SUNY, stating that State University campuses began chartering non-profit corporations in the 1950s to administer campus activities and:</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	to further insulate NYS from services with high liability exposure and because NYS agency requirements and systems for accounting, reporting, and budgeting can not effectively accommodate retail and consumer service enterprises.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn11"" name=""_ftnref11"" title="""">[11]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	There are three main purposes for the establishment of ASCs; to protect SUNY campuses from liability issues, to provide SUNY with agencies that can more actively engage with private capital, and to take advantage of tax breaks and public funding available to corporations in New York State through Industrial Development Agency (IDA) financing.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Prior to ASCs, many campuses had Faculty Student Associations (FSA), including University at Albany. It is unclear when FSA began, but it switched from FSA to UAS over the summer of 1976. About a year prior to the transition, University at Albany students had voted themselves as a majority on two of the FSA boards. As an <em>Albany Student Press</em> article recounts, &ldquo;besides a basic yearning of the students involved to achieve a greater voice in FSA, what helped to bring about the dramatic actions of the day was the inopportune absence of a faculty member.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn12"" name=""_ftnref12"" title="""">[12]</a> Student members of FSA, realizing they had a voting majority, restructured the bylaws to allow for a student majority on the FSA membership board and the FSA board of directors. Shorty afterwards, students mobilized to vote in a student FSA President and pass a 4% rebate for students with meal plans.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn13"" name=""_ftnref13"" title="""">[13]</a> The rebate exemplified the fact that students were dissatisfied with how FSA was doing business on campus, mainly the fact that they were attempting to accrue funds for other campus activities on the backs of students and their meal plan dollars. Students argued that FSA had accumulated an excess of funds over the previous 3 years which belonged to students and therefore should be given back.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	About a year after students voted themselves as a majority in FSA, it was transformed into UAS. There is no note in the <em>Albany Student Press</em> of what motivated the change at UAlbany&rsquo;s campus; in a June 1976 article there is simply a parenthetical reference to UAS as the former FSA. Yet, SASA&rsquo;s website provides some statewide context to these changes noting that in 1967 a statewide committee was appointed by the Vice Chancellor for Business and Finance to review the scope of FSAs SUNY-wide.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn14"" name=""_ftnref14"" title="""">[14]</a> The committee recommended more standardization throughout the SUNY system and the report comments that:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	[T]he rather informal association governance style attendant to campus FSAs gradually gave way to the more structured membership corporation model we have today, collectively referred to as Auxiliary Service Corporations (ASCs).<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn15"" name=""_ftnref15"" title="""">[15]</a></p>
<p>
	<br />
	While not explicitly stated, an &ldquo;informal association governance style&rdquo; could read as a governance style more susceptible to student control or open to democratic processes in locations where students or other members of the community were able to gain active control of FSA boards. Either way, the shift from FSA to UAS resulted in a more corporatized structure that would make it impossible, in its contemporary form, for UAlbany students to gain majority control over a UAS board ever again.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn16"" name=""_ftnref16"" title="""">[16]</a></p>

	There are conflicting records on the date University Auxiliary Services was established, the <em>Albany Student Press </em>starts mentioning its existence in June 1976, but the UAS office dates its establishment to 1950.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn17"" name=""_ftnref17"" title="""">[17]</a> The shift from FSA to UAS marked a change in the governance structure of campus service management that began to move its operations further away from the logics of public governance. For example, the governance bodies of public institutions are subject to Freedom of Information Law requests and Open Meetings Law yet there has been contestation over whether ASCs in SUNY are subject to those laws. The main point of contention is whether or not ASCs are &ldquo;public bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The NYS Committee on Open Government has issued three opinions on auxiliary corporations within SUNY commenting on the confusing nature of auxiliary corporations and their relationship to the state. In 1993, the United Industry Workers Local 424 requested SUNY Farmingdale&rsquo;s Request for Proposal (RFP) for food service and the contract between SUNY Farmingdale and Bon App&eacute;tit Management and was denied.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn18"" name=""_ftnref18"" title="""">[18]</a> The union representative was requesting the information because of concerns that, &ldquo;[SUNY Farmingdale] &lsquo;through its &lsquo;Auxiliary Service Corporation&rsquo; has contracted with Bon Appetit Management of California&rsquo;, and that a number of employees &lsquo;may face job loss and health care loss due to the contractor&#39;s position.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn19"" name=""_ftnref19"" title="""">[19]</a> Robert Freeman, Director of the Committee on Open Government, commented that:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	If the Auxiliary Services Corporation exists due to its relationship with SUNY College at Farmingdale, and if the College would perform the functions of the Corporation if the Corporation had not been created, it might be concluded that such an entity conducts public business and performs a governmental function for the University.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn20"" name=""_ftnref20"" title="""">[20]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Freeman is challenging ASCs position as an agency wholly separate from a public institution by asserting that since it carries out the functions of a public institution it should be subject to the same rules and regulations.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The issue of ASCs status as a public or non-public agency was brought to the attention of the Committee on Open Government again in 1998 and 2001. In 2001, a University at Albany student requested an opinion from the Committee on Open Government because the student had been asked to leave a UAS meeting prior to the approval of a meal plan fee hike and told by the UAS Executive Director that UAS was subject to neither Open Meetings Law nor FOIL requests. In response, Director Robert Freeman argued that:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	I believe that each condition necessary to a finding that the board of UAS is a &quot;public body&quot; may be met. It is an entity for which a quorum is required pursuant to the provisions of the Not-for-Profit Corporation Law. It consists of more than two members. In view of the degree of governmental control exercised by and its nexus with the University at Albany, I believe that it conducts public business and performs a governmental function for a governmental entity.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn21"" name=""_ftnref21"" title="""">[21]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Here Freeman again asserts that ASCs, despite their attempts to skirt public law, are public bodies, performing public functions. All three opinions (1993, 1998, and 2001) occur around the time when ASCs began contracting more heavily with outside corporate vendors and two pertain, either directly or tangentially, to UAS&rsquo; relationship with a contractor.</p>
<p>

<p>
	<em>II. UAS Subcontracts Food Service to Sodexho-Marriott </em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Over the past 30 years campus food services at University at Albany has been managed by three different parties. Before 1999, campus food service was managed by the Faculty Student Association (FSA) which later became University Auxiliary Services (UAS); both were considered University bodies and therefore workers were managed directly by the University. In July 1999, UAS made the decision to subcontract campus dining services to a private corporation and awarded the contract to Sodexho-Marriott who managed the food service contract until June 2000. On July 1, 2000 Chartwells, a division of the Compass Group, took over the contract and currently manages food service at University at Albany.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.75in;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In the Spring of 1999, Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees (HERE) organized a union drive among campus food service workers at the University at Albany, SUNY.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn22"" name=""_ftnref22"" title="""">[22]</a> After 70% of the workers signed cards expressing their desire to have a union, the cards were delivered to University Auxiliary Services (UAS). In June of 1999, UAS agreed to recognize the union, yet less than a month later they contracted out to the Sodexho-Marriott Corporation who took over the food service contract on July 1, 1999.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn23"" name=""_ftnref23"" title="""">[23]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Under Sodexho-Marriott working conditions worsened and the companyrefused to recognize the union. As Larry Wittner explains:</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	The company stripped workers of hundreds of hours of accumulated sick time and, also, quadruped their health insurance premiums.&nbsp; As workers were paid only $6 to $7 an hour, many had no choice but to opt out of Sodexho-Marriott&#39;s expensive health care plan.&nbsp; Facing reduced benefits and deteriorating working conditions, the number of regular employees plummeted.&nbsp; Because of the now chronic understaffing, most workers put in 12-hour shifts.&nbsp; Workers were told that they could not discuss job conditions among themselves or with others.&nbsp; And when some dared to wear &quot;Union Yes&quot; pins, Sodexho-Marriott managers ordered them to remove these traces of resistance.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn24"" name=""_ftnref24"" title="""">[24]</a></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In response to Sodexho&rsquo;s unwillingness to recognize the union, students, faculty and community members formed the Student-Labor Initiative (SLI, pronounced &quot;sly&quot;) and began organizing actions to draw attention to Sodexho&rsquo;s anti-union practices as well as their investment in privatized prisons nationally.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn25"" name=""_ftnref25"" title="""">[25]</a> HERE, Local 471 simultaneously filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the National Labor Relations Board.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn26"" name=""_ftnref26"" title="""">[26]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Members of the campus community mounted a year-long campaign to back the campus food service workers right to unionize. In response, UAS and other University administrators attempted to avoid involvement in the labor dispute. Wittner states, &ldquo;despite these early protests, the assorted campus managers&mdash;the administration, UAS, and Sodexho-Marriott&mdash;resorted to every possible excuse to evade the issue of the mistreatment of food service workers.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn27"" name=""_ftnref27"" title="""">[27]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Despite the University and UASs assertions that an intervention was beyond their scope, campus discontent with Sodexho continued to mount and an outbreak of e-coli bacteria in the Indian Dining Hall at the end of March exacerbated dissatisfaction with the company. In April, the campaign intensified and culminated in a sit-in in the University President&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>
	Amber Martin, a student organizer, commented, &ldquo;Our message [is] loud and clear: boot Sodexho-Marriott and hold all campus contractors to basic standards of behavior towards their workers.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn28"" name=""_ftnref28"" title="""">[28]</a> Less than a month later, UAS announced its decision to end the contract with Sodexho-Marriott and put out a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a new food service provider. Sodexho&rsquo;s contract had only lasted for one academic year (1999-2000).</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<em>III. Chartwells, UAS, and Workers United Local 471</em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	On July 1, 2000 Chartwells, a division of the Compass Group, took over the contract and currently manages food service at University at Albany. While there may have been other worker and union struggles during Chartwells&rsquo; management, I focus on Fall 2009, when Chartwells prohibited the union representative from entering the dining halls.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn29"" name=""_ftnref29"" title="""">[29]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In September 2009, the Workers United, Local 471 union representative, Amanda Lefton investigated a number of workplace grievances including potentially hazardous working conditions, delays in holiday pay, and wage violations. In one instance, workers had to work in 110-degree conditions when two vents in the Colonial Quad dining hall broke.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn30"" name=""_ftnref30"" title="""">[30]</a> As one worker stated, &ldquo;We went two or three days in those conditions. Chartwells didn&rsquo;t help at all until the complaints got heavy.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn31"" name=""_ftnref31"" title="""">[31]</a> Shortly after Lefton began pursuing grievances and attempting to hold Chartwells to the collective bargaining agreement, she was notified that Chartwells would no longer recognize Workers United, Local 471 as the appropriate bargaining unit and therefore Lefton was not allowed on the premises. Chartwells refused to meet with Lefton, started placing union dues in escrow, advised workers not to post notices on union bulletin boards, and told workers not to speak with students about working conditions when off the clock.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn32"" name=""_ftnref32"" title="""">[32]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Chartwells justified their actions on the basis that there was a national dispute between UNITE HERE and Service Employees International Union (SEIU). According to a report sent to United University Professions (UUP):</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	Earlier this year Chartwells received competing representation claims from UNITE HERE and the Rochester Regional Joint Board (Workers United-SEIU) regarding our hourly associates at University at Albany. These competing claims are related to the disaffiliation of the Rochester Regional Joint Board (RRJB), as well as multiple other joint boards across the country, from UNITE HERE and their subsequent affiliation with SEIU.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn33"" name=""_ftnref33"" title="""">[33]</a></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<h6>
	In April 2009, Local 471 decided to disaffiliate with UNITE HERE. Although Chartwells stated the reason for denying Lefton access to the campus was due to competing representation claims, Chartwells had waited over 5 months to act. Due to the timing of Chartwells&rsquo; action, Workers United, Local 471 viewed their decision to ban Lefton from the University at Albany campus as retaliation for the filing of successful grievances stating, &ldquo;This is blatant retaliation against the workers for attempting to prevent wage violations and aggressively investigating hazardous working conditions.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn34"" name=""_ftnref34"" title="""">[34]</a> The union also asserted that workers had chosen to have Workers United, Local 471 represent them stating, &ldquo;The Union members, have voiced their choice three times to keep their Union, Workers United Local 471.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn35"" name=""_ftnref35"" title="""">[35]</a><a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn35"" name=""_ftnref35"" title=""""></a></h6>
<h6>
	&nbsp;</h6>
<h6>
	Following Lefton&rsquo;s banning from the University at Albany campus, she began to contact campus union representatives and student organizations to mobilize against Chartwells&rsquo; decision. Larry Wittner, Chair of the Albany Chapter UUP Solidarity Committee, agreed to organize a meeting with members of Local 471 to discuss Chartwells&rsquo; decision to terminate union representation. On Wednesday November 11, 2009 at 11:30am, campus food service workers and members of Workers United, Local 471, students and faculty members gathered in front of the Campus Center to protest Chartwells&rsquo; actions. A number of student speakers emphasized that the food service workers were undoubtedly a part of the UAlbany community. Bredan Anderson, UAlbany student and member of the College Democrats stated, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to stand by while some folks in our community are taken advantage of and neither should the University nor its students.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn36"" name=""_ftnref36"" title="""">[36]</a> Ben Jacobs, another UAlbany student and member of the College Democrats also emphasized the workers place in the UAlbany community stating:</h6>
<h6>
	&nbsp;</h6>
<h6>
	We&rsquo;re here to say, as students, that the Chartwells workers and the food service workers on this campus are part of our community and we will not tolerate the mistreatment of them or anyone else in our community. It is our duty and our responsibility to make sure that there is fair and equal treatment of everyone on this campus.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn37"" name=""_ftnref37"" title="""">[37]</a></h6>
<h6>
	&nbsp;</h6>
<h6>
	Those at the rally were clearly contesting the University&rsquo;s position that since food service workers were managed by Chartwells, the University had no responsibility in enforcing labor rights.</h6>
<h6>
	&nbsp;</h6>
<h6>
	After rallying in front of the Campus Center, the rally marched to the President&rsquo;s office where Rev. Mike Roberts, District Director of Workers United, Local 471 and Tracey Cobbs, Chartwells&rsquo; worker and Union leader entered the building and asked to speak with President George Philip. Roberts and Cobbs were met by Kevin Wilcox, University Controller and board member of University Auxiliary Services. Wilcox stated, &ldquo;This is not my issue. To be honest, this is not a University issue. This is an issue with Chartwells.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn38"" name=""_ftnref38"" title="""">[38]</a> Roberts responded stating,</h6>
<h6>
	&ldquo;So far, as you are, the President is trying to maintain that SUNY Albany does not have the right to insist that its vendors behave ethically.&rdquo; Wilcox later insisted again, &ldquo;Let me make something clear, they&rsquo;re not University workers.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn39"" name=""_ftnref39"" title="""">[39]</a> Wilcox then agreed to take a message for the President, but refused to be involved. Cobbs voiced her frustration with Wilcox stating:</h6>
<h6>
	&nbsp;</h6>
<h6>
	No one right now wants to take responsibility for anything. Compass [Group] just had someone come in and tell us they&rsquo;re not responsible. We&rsquo;re being told by the President they&rsquo;re not responsible. Somebody on this campus is responsible for something.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn40"" name=""_ftnref40"" title="""">[40]</a></h6>
<h6>
	&nbsp;</h6>
<h6>
	Wilcox was not interested in whether or not Chartwells was upholding basic labor standards, but based his argument in the logic that campus food service workers were not University workers and therefore the University was not responsible for the enforcement of labor rights. By framing the argument as an issue of responsibility, Wilcox discursively positioned campus food service workers as outsiders, not entitled to the same rights as other University workers or members of the campus community.</h6>
<h6>
	&nbsp;</h6>
<p>
	<em>Conclusion: Neoliberalism and the Transformation of Campus Food Service Labor and University Governance</em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Capitalism has always put considerable pressure on the University, but the particularities of restructuring under neoliberalism have significantly transformed labor relations and University governance at the University at Albany. Auxiliary Service Corporations were formed SUNY-wide beginning in the 1950s and were established to protect SUNY campuses from liability issues, to provide SUNY with agencies that could more actively engage with private capital, and to take advantage of tax breaks and public funding available to corporations in New York State. The structure of UAS allowed for the limiting of a student voice on its board and a broader limiting of public engagement with University decisions by attempts to close meetings and records to the public. Also, the UAS structure allowed for the outsourcing of campus services leading to the exclusion of campus food service workers from the campus community and a worsening of working conditions and benefits. The Board members of UAS&rsquo; have attempted to limit the space for resistance by contesting UAS&rsquo; &lsquo;public&rsquo; function, by defining campus food service workers as non-University workers, and limiting student representation on its board. If we are to build a more inclusive, democratic University the structures on campus must be transformed to cater to public engagement and the inclusion of a broader campus community which includes campus food service workers.</p>

	Anticipation of Safety</p>
<p>
	The observation I conducted in Columbia was right here at our University.&nbsp; The surveillance of Thomas Cooper Library (TCL) at the University of South Carolina was indeed substantial and impressive.&nbsp; Thomas Cooper Library is 35 years old and encompasses a space of 290,000 square feet containing 45 miles of shelves, holding 1.5 million volumes! This is no small place to survey.&nbsp; Upon my first exploration of the surveillance of TCL, I counted 26 cameras in the entire library and 14 cameras in the Ernest F. Hollings Special Collections Library.&nbsp; I had no idea that there were so many cameras watching the students, faculty, and visitors of the facility. Here is a <a href=""http://library.sc.edu/crosssection.html"">cross section</a>of the 7 floors of TCL.</p>
<p align=""center"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	For the surveillance observation of TCL, I chose to monitor two cameras located in front of the entrance.&nbsp; These are two Honeywell security cameras mounted to the sides of a column located in the lobby.&nbsp; One of the cameras views the left of the front doors and the other looks straight towards the front doors. &nbsp;I decided to observe this area because these two cameras see every person that enters and exits the library.&nbsp; In the event of any crime or misdemeanor, the footage from these cameras will be checked first.&nbsp; I was also curious to see how many people noticed the cameras upon entering the library, and if they reacted to them.&nbsp; This is a map of the main level of the library, where the two cameras that I observed are located:</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<table cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""100%"">
	<tbody>

				<div>
					<p align=""center"">
						<em>Security Cameras located here</em></p>
				</div>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	During my study of TCL on June 15, 2011, from 10:30am- 12:30pm, I noticed that almost all of the people entering the library did not even notice the camera directly in front of the door.&nbsp; Most of the people entering came in at a steady pace and knew the direction they were headed.&nbsp; Few people stood in front of the door for a couple seconds deciding where to go.&nbsp; I only noticed one person looking at the camera as they walked through the door, and two people seemed to avoid the camera as they walked through.&nbsp; The first had his face turned down and away from the camera, and the second had his head turned away from the camera and walked very quickly.&nbsp; During my observation, there was also a librarian walking around the front of the library monitoring students.&nbsp; She made her way around the perimeter of computers located in the lobby a few times and stood by the front door looking in for a couple minutes, and then disappeared back to a desk.</p>
<p>
	Making this data quantifiable added something more to my observation as well. I decided to take count of the number of people entering the library and leaving while I was there. I tallied every person who walked through the doors.&nbsp; The number of exiting peoples was easier to obtain, as there is always an employee of the library sitting by the exit with a clicker to count every person who leaves.&nbsp; So, I talked with the head of security, Tucky Taylor, and she had no problem with me obtaining that number for my observation.&nbsp; So, these are the numbers:</p>
<p>
	People Coming in the Library, 10:50am-12:30pm &ndash; 220</p>
<p>
	People Leaving, 10am- 12:30pm - 320</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My experience of observing the surveillance at TCL was interesting, because it forced me to step outside my comfort zone and question something new.&nbsp;&nbsp; While I was going around looking at all of the cameras during my first observation, I became aware of my own worry that someone was watching me.&nbsp; My hyper-awareness of being approached by faculty or security made me somewhat uncomfortable.&nbsp; By acting out of the norm and searching for surveillance, I felt that I made myself noticeable.&nbsp; By the same token, during my second day of observation I became the surveyor and caused other people to become aware of my watching them.&nbsp; While I sat by the front door, I also decided to tally the number of people that looked at me as they walked in.&nbsp; This number was nowhere near the total number of people entering, but it was interesting that so many did notice my eyes on them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	People looking at me- 43</p>
<p>
	Here Christopher Slobogin&rsquo;s notion of public anonymity is interesting to consider.&nbsp; When you walk into the library, you participate in the functioning of public anonymity unless you step outside the norm of student behavior for some reason, as I had.&nbsp; You are nameless and invisible until you behave criminally or do something out of the norm.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was no longer nameless and invisible when I approached the employee at the exit to acquire data about people leaving, or when I spoke with the head of security at the front of the library.&nbsp; My presence became known because I made myself known to the library staff.&nbsp; In a similar way, the individualizing function of discipline happens in the library as well.&nbsp; Many students come into the library to use the computers.&nbsp; We are required to type in our individual USC id number and password to log on to a computer.&nbsp; This identification number holds our personal information with the University.&nbsp; We are &ldquo;separated off&rdquo; from others by this, because the institution knows which computer we are on and likely what we are doing.</p>
<p>
	Before my observation, I talked with Tucky Taylor about the security of TCL.&nbsp; I was surprised to learn of the prevalence of theft in the library, but she explained that <strong>&ldquo;the library was the perfect place to steal from&rdquo;</strong>.&nbsp; She said this was because people come to the library over and over and they begin to feel safe there.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t think anyone would ever steal their stuff or anything could happen there.&nbsp; She described there being an <strong>&ldquo;aura of safety in the library&rdquo;</strong>.&nbsp; However, this is precisely how theft happens so often.&nbsp; Opportunity arises and people are desperate for money, so they steal.&nbsp; People run out of their loan money, can&rsquo;t afford their bills, or whatever the case may be.&nbsp; Taylor says theft is often times more opportunity crimes than pattern crimes, and they catch the guilty about half of the time.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;This opportunity theft in a realm of safety becomes interesting in light of Richard Grusin&rsquo;s notion of anticipation as a function of the logic of security.&nbsp; Grusin describes a state of anticipation of security that allows for pre-emptive measures to be taken to intervene in crime.&nbsp; Premediation is <strong>&ldquo;&hellip;the implementation of premediated algorithms of data mining and risk analysis to uncover patterns of suspicious behavior before they could be actualized&hellip;&rdquo;</strong> (Grusin 123).&nbsp; Just as in the film <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/""><em>Minority Report</em></a>, crimes could be avoided by effective pre-emption.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Premediation encourages our society to network and mobilize, and make ourselves visible and susceptible to security and the kinds of surveillance it entails in order to collect data and take pre-emptive measures to protect ourselves.</p>
<p>
	<strong>&ldquo;Our everyday transactions of mediation, transportation, and communication are encouraged for security purposes not only by making them easy and readily available but also by making them affectively pleasurable&hellip;by maintaining low levels of affective intensity that provide a kind of buffer or safe space&hellip;&rdquo;</strong>(Grusin 126).</p>
<p>
	This quote describes the &ldquo;safe&rdquo; space available for us to communicate and work through media. The library has come to be a place of safety for its&rsquo; visitors and the surveillance cameras operating there communicate safety to us.&nbsp; However, the fact of the matter is that we don&rsquo;t even recognize them anymore but we always anticipate their being there. &nbsp;Opportunities that might present themselves to potential thieves in the library are encouraged to be avoided, by signs warning students not to leave their belongings unattended. &nbsp;Students often don&rsquo;t even notice these signs. &nbsp;This is how risk management works: it relies on a tension between prevalent and anticipated existence of cameras and a lack of awareness of them.</p>

	<em>The Four Points</em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I observed the intersection of Main St. and Hampton St. in Columbia, SC on June 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup>, 2011. Beyond the obvious traffic-pedestrian-&amp; vehicular movement-I noticed four different sites of circulation.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Sites of circulation:</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Sylvan Bros. Jewelers (merchandise/commerce): circulation of good</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Wachovia Bank (business/finance): circulation of currency</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Art Museum (art/culture): circulation of knowledge/ideas</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Marriott Hotel (tourism/travel): circulation of bodies/people</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	These four sites of circulation become more interesting in light of Michel Foucault. He talks about security management and regulation. Through his insights I am able to draw the conclusion that all four areas of the intersection are all working as a network of sorts.</p>

	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	There were nine cameras that I counted in the one block intersection, on the corners of the street. I feel that the amount of cameras in used to increase the opportunity of catching someone in the act of doing something wrong.&nbsp; This amount of camera surveillance serves to expand the panopticon theory from a small area of focus, to a much larger, more elaborate layout. Whoever is monitoring the area is in full control, with the individuals on the street completely unaware of their surveillance.</p>

	&ldquo;The antithesis of public anonymity is the Panopticon, a model prison first imagined by Jeremy Bentham. The panopticon is a circular, with the prison cells and walkways placed around the perimeter and the guard station placed on the top of a tower in the middle, an arrangement enabling a large number of prisoners to be watched by just a few guards. In theory, every movement of every person could be monitored as such.&rdquo;</p>

	<strong>- Connections:</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the movie <em>Minority Report,</em> we see the circulation all of the above mentioned aspects of culture. We see the circulation of knowledge, goods, currency, and people all take place in the scene in which Tom Cruises&rsquo; character is walking through the mall. There is apparent cultural value shown in this scene. Just like the museum that I watched, there was a circulation of knowledge and ideas shown through the art that is displayed, in the movie, there are images all over the mall hallway. There is also a visible connection between the mall and the jewelry store that I watched. There is a circulation of goods and products in both instances. The Marriott Hotel that I surveilled is an example of a circulation of people/bodies. In <em>Minority Report</em> the movement of the people in the mall hallway qualify as a circ. of people as well. Lastly, the bank that I stationed myself at, and the use of money in the movie, connect to the circulation of currency.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the corner of Main and Hampton, I recognize that all of the different forms of surveillance seem to always be in conversation. They are all part of a network that complements one another. The cameras near the jewelers cover a little bit of the street near the hotel. The hotel has cameras facing the bank and the street. The bank&rsquo;s cameras catch not only the hotel, but the museum as well. The museum has a security guard who can see all four corners with no problem. We see in this context of intersection the ways that surveillance at each site is working together. This makes it quite manageable for the owners to help one another regulate their businesses efficiently.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>-Thoughts:</strong></p>
<p>
	Lastly, I want to raise a final question for my report: Why, once we see and recognize a camera as surveillance, do we keep looking back at it as if it has a soul? Why are we not satisfied with one initial look at the camera? Well, humans are naturally paranoid, anxious, etc. We get nervous thinking that we aren&rsquo;t the only ones that are aware of our actions, before and, or, during the actual instance of occurrence. That&rsquo;s the only answer I can think of... I for one can say that I always look at cameras over and over again as if they were a human figure. It&rsquo;s a weird condition that we are used to and accept at this point in society. Obviously the main point of any form of surveillance is safety and protection. However we pay the price of having our individual lives being invaded quite a bit in order for this to occur. The movie <em>Minority Report</em>, blows this idea out of proportion, but nails it right on the head. &ldquo;Pre-crime&rdquo; mirrors directly a very advanced, yet parallel form of surveillance to our culture today. The idea that we can stop/maintain a level of crime, if, and only if, we can somewhat &ldquo;invade&rdquo; the lives around us.</p>

	<u>I Always Feel Like Somebody&rsquo;s Watching Me</u></p>
<p>
	My observation site was located in the <a href=""http://www.vistaontheriver.com/"">Vista</a> of Columbia, SC.&nbsp; The Vista is a historic area of downtown Columbia filled with shops, restaurants, and bars.&nbsp; My observation took place mainly at the corner of Lincoln St. and Gervais St.&nbsp; I spent the majority of my time sitting outside a Starbucks on the corner and surveying the entire Lincoln intersection.&nbsp; There were times when I walked up and down the street but ultimately ended back at the Starbucks intersection.&nbsp; From this location, I could observe the north and south of Lincoln Street as well as both cameras I decided to examine.</p>
<p>
	I chose to observe two cameras that were located on top of opposite street lights (refer to picture below) at the intersection of Lincoln Street and Gervais St.&nbsp; The reason I chose these two cameras was because of the constant traffic at this location.&nbsp; The few other cameras in the area weren&rsquo;t positioned near any type of commotion.&nbsp; I believe the two cameras were positioned to see not only the intersection, but the entirety of Lincoln Street.&nbsp; Due to the lack of other cameras in the area, I think these two were placed to make up for lost surveillance.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	I gathered a lot from my observations.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not going to say that people weren&rsquo;t aware of the cameras, because they were positioned quite obviously; but I just don&rsquo;t think they cared that much.&nbsp; There were times when someone would spot the camera at the last minute and hit their breaks thinking that would save them from being caught speeding.&nbsp; This could be because it was midday and people were rushing to get lunch before returning to work.&nbsp; Within fifteen minutes of arriving at the location, I witnessed someone drive through a red light, and a few more instances of the same throughout the day.&nbsp; The cameras didn&rsquo;t seem to hinder people too much.&nbsp; I did witness many police cars patrolling the area though; and when they were around, time seemed to slow down because people would drive slower and obey street signs, lights, etc&hellip;After they spotted the police, they continued down the road at a steady pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	This brings to our attention Richard Grusin&rsquo;s remarks about the anticipation of security.&nbsp; Implicitly we know we&rsquo;re being watched and/or recorded.&nbsp; This is anticipation&mdash;but very subtle.&nbsp; It is anticipation as Richard Grusin describes it.&nbsp; Anticipation works on the premise that &ldquo;data can be generated&rdquo; (142) so that dots can be connected about various events.&nbsp; Because we know this, we feel the safety of predictability.&nbsp; But in moments when it&rsquo;s made visible [police cars] we snap to attention with a sort of surprise.&nbsp; When people are confronted with the fact of security, subtle anticipation turns to awareness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Whether people were walking or driving, they were always on the move.&nbsp; Majority of the people walking went straight to Starbucks and then left.&nbsp; There weren&rsquo;t a whole lot of people lingering, it was just constant movement.&nbsp; I would say that the people walking were less aware of the cameras than the people driving.&nbsp; Many people throughout the day were crossing the streets where they saw fit. &nbsp;The crosswalks were rarely used.&nbsp; The first thought that develops when you spot the two cameras, is that they were placed on top of the stop lights to make drivers cautious of their actions.&nbsp; But this may be a tactic to deceive people.&nbsp; The cameras may not be paying attention to the car traffic at all; they may be surveying the pedestrians and businesses up and down Lincoln Street.&nbsp; I consider this quite likely.</p>
<p>
	Gervais Street is an extremely busy street: it leads further into the city and alongside the statehouse; but the cameras weren&rsquo;t surveying this street.&nbsp; They were monitoring the activity along Lincoln Street (or lack there of). There are a few attractions that are located among this street:&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.columbiaconventioncenter.com/"">The Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center</a> and two bars called Wild Hare and Bull Market tavern.&nbsp; The bars are a potential goldmine for surveillance enthusiasts, or to put it more simply, police.&nbsp; They attract young adults come nighttime with their weekly drink specials and huge crowds.&nbsp; This also makes it a targeted area for potential criminal and other deviant or illicit activity.&nbsp; As people leave the bars intoxicated, they could be inclined to drive or fall victim to accident or harm, both of which would be observed by these two cameras. The same situation occurs when the convention center has events.&nbsp; The street becomes flooded with traffic.&nbsp; Crowds are messy; and the cameras provide a means to keep an &ldquo;eye&rdquo; on the situation.&nbsp; I believe the cameras were strategically placed here for these purposes.</p>

<p>
	During my time observing Lincoln St., I began to realize how Michel Foucault&rsquo;s Panopticism exists in our everyday lives, even if it&rsquo;s in the most subtle of ways.&nbsp; The essential idea behind Foucault&rsquo;s Panopticism is the methodical controlling of human behavior through restrained and frequently unknown means.&nbsp; The two cameras on the stop lights suggest this same theory.&nbsp; Gervais Street appears to be surveyed and because of that, drivers on this street might act accordingly.&nbsp; Much like how in the movie <u>Red Road</u> (2006), the main antagonist, Clyde Henderson, is being surveyed constantly (he is a parolee) but is never certain of when he is being surveyed. &nbsp;Henderson is trying to go straight which shows a sign of his awareness of being watched.&nbsp; Because of this, we never really see Clyde misbehave on the surveillance cameras. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The two cameras I was observing were actually positioned to see north and south of Lincoln Street, covering the bars and the convention center, and other curious areas.&nbsp; The cameras seem to be controlling both streets with very little application.&nbsp; This strategy compliments Foucault&rsquo;s theory by reinforcing the uncertainty and therefore effortlessly influencing public behavior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The concept behind modern Panopticism provides some social stability: it prevents the idea of malicious conduct from actualizing.&nbsp; Everyday we are subject to observation; but it is a necessary evil.&nbsp; Should the thought of offensive behavior surface in us, the thought of being caught will supersede it.</p>

	<strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The camera next to Sid &amp; Nancy has a long view angle that can record traffic moving along the sidewalk as well as any movement that passes through the alley way towards the back of the shops. The cameras advantage to track so much activity on such a busy street made it ideal for mass observation.</p>

	<strong>Vantage point description:</strong> I sat outdoors, under Delaney&rsquo;s canopy closest to Sid &amp; Nancy and to the right of Delaney&rsquo;s front door. This view gave me access to activity both in front of me (down the sidewalk toward Blossom Street) and behind me (the alley way).</p>

	<strong>Observation:</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:30 &ndash; 80 degrees. Three men stand down the street near the green awning. They are all different ages. The oldest man wears a long sleeved button up striped shirt. It is tucked in. He isn&rsquo;t working. Another man wears reflective sunglasses and a glasses strap, and stands beside the older man. He is younger. Both men wear khakis. The third man wears shorts and a t-shirt, possibly college affiliated, but is probably in his late thirties like the second man.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:35 - The third man uses a staple gun on the fa&ccedil;ade to a building as he stands on a short foot ladder to reach his mark.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:40 &ndash; The third man starts using a caulking gun. I think they are repairing or replacing the fa&ccedil;ade.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:45 &ndash; The man in the reflective glasses still isn&rsquo;t working. He feigns interest. He watches the man work for a bit before walking inside. Both men have left the guy in shorts working alone. He is in the sun.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:50 &ndash; Food service truck &ndash; blocks my view of the street. Pulls up directly in front of Delaney&rsquo;s. Young black man starts to unload it. He wears a blue uniform and shorts. He says &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to me when I look at him. He has disappeared behind the other side of the truck.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:55 &ndash; The lady at Sid &amp; Nancy recognizes me, but I don&rsquo;t recognize her. She&rsquo;s wearing dark sunglasses and a black &ldquo;Ramones&rdquo; tank top. She looked nicer yesterday. She asks me if I know Carey. She offers that he is the &ldquo;guy who installed all the surveillance cameras&rdquo; and I should call him if I need some help.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:56 &ndash; She disappears into her shop and reemerges with her phone and the number. I take it down. She leaves me. I&rsquo;m invisible again!</p>

<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Young white lady. She wears a long flower dress and watches me. She seems to know the men doing construction.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Fat white guy wearing long sleeves and headphones. He walks with a purpose, but doesn&rsquo;t enter any shops.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Lady in the flower dress smokes a cigarette. She also seems to know a bald man on the street.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:05 &ndash; Waitress has feathers in her hair. She starts setting up the chalk board outside. She, too, knows many a passerby. The lady in the flower dress paces between stores while she smokes.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:10 &ndash; The lady in the flower dress doesn&rsquo;t litter. She puts her cigarette out in the bin that&rsquo;s attached to the wall, but she&rsquo;s smoked it to the filter. The waitresses have turned on the fans outside.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:14 &ndash; Intermission &ndash; Check in with Cooley</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:27 - The two non-workers are back. A lady in a red ball cap talks on her cell phone near them. She doesn&rsquo;t have any hair. She crosses the street, out of view.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:30 &ndash; The working man in the shorts and t-shirt leans over his work table. A guy with his lap top walks by. It&rsquo;s tiny! He wears shorts. He walks into the coffee shop, I think.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:32 &ndash; The food truck still hasn&rsquo;t left. A man with a manila envelope walks into the coffee shop. A lady walks out with too coffees. She is young and wears light blue jeans and black scuffed boots.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:35 &ndash; A lady with red hair and an African patterned bag walks by. She wears a long black and tan dress that features a number of geometric shapes all over it. It&rsquo;s very unlike her bag that she carries. She disappears down the street.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:36 &ndash; The food truck man emerges from the back of the truck with a hand truck full of boxes. He wheels it down the alley.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:38 &ndash; A young blonde girl lingers down the side walk while she talks on her cell phone. She talks for a minute and then goes into a store.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:39 &ndash; A black lady examines an article of clothing on the rack outside of one of the stores. She heads inside.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:40 &ndash; I explain &ldquo;BOGO&rdquo; (buy one get one free) to some confused middle-aged people. They walk away from Delaney&rsquo;s sign, unimpressed. They stare in each window they pass as they slowly make their way down the street, examining everything that they see. I get the impression they don&rsquo;t come to 5-Points often.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:41 &ndash; A lady dressed in olive green scrubs walks up the street.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:42 &ndash; The food truck man rolls up his ramp into the back of his truck.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:43 &ndash; The working man starts putting materials that look like molding into the back of his truck, but he doesn&rsquo;t leave. He measures something on the wall.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:44 &ndash; The food service truck drives away.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11: 45 &ndash; The flower dress lady emerges from one store and walks into Delaney&rsquo;s</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:46 &ndash; The working man continues to measure. Flower dress lady steps outside and lights a cigarette. She starts to ask me about my project.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:52 &ndash; The conversation ends.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	What I learned:</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* The majority of the cameras I noted the day before are only about a year old.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* The 5-Points Association paid to have them installed.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* The Association pays a monthly surveillance fee to have them operated and serviced.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Since the city owns the sidewalks, they monitor the cameras when they choose.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* The cameras have been successful apprehending car burglars, purse snatchers, property damagers (Revente once had their window broken in the middle of the night by a drunk kid who was later caught), and street thieves and drunks in general.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* The camera quality is &ldquo;pretty good&rdquo;.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Carey (the guy who installed the cameras) is nice. I should call him. I do. He doesn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:59 &ndash; A couple shows up and sits down two tables from me. The woman has a tan and long brown hair. She&rsquo;s probably in her 40&rsquo;s. The man with her is probably around her age, but he looks younger. He is wearing sunglasses even in the shade of the canopy. I think they&rsquo;re suspicious of me. They both keep looking my direction. They drink Pepsi&rsquo;s.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:02 &ndash; The working man has stopped working. He talks on his cell phone in the shade. A girl in a pink neon skirt walks into a store with a woman who is probably her mom. I don&rsquo;t notice what the mom wears because of how distracted I am by the girls blindingly neon skirt.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:04 - Neon skirt girl is back. She and her mom walk to their car. It&rsquo;s a large black SUV. I notice her mom&rsquo;s clothing for the first time. She wears pink Nike running shorts and tennis shoes. I immediately think of young college students who admire the style. Like her daughter, she wears a fair amount of make-up. I suspect the mom isn&rsquo;t donning the running shorts and tennis shoes to do anything more than shop. They wander aimlessly from store to store.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:08 &ndash; Neon skirt girl and her mom never seemed to have purchased anything. I don&rsquo;t see any bags. They retreat slowly to their car and leave.</p>

	Before even making my way down to the second shop on Saluda on the first day of observation, I was quickly approached by a store owner who was suspicious of my activities outside her door. She had valid reasons for being suspicious of course. No human in their right mind would idle outdoors in Columbia, South Carolina in the middle of the summer and in the heat of the day unless they absolutely had to. Little did she know I absolutely had to, and thus found myself taking notes about the camera fixed on the other side of her shop window, placed high on the wall for pedestrians like myself to observe. That was what they were there for, wasn&rsquo;t it; a visible deterrent? In any event, she came marching out and seemed a bit angry when she accosted me to discover the reason I was loitering outside her door with a notebook. After I apologized (she made it seem like I should), I explained I was working on a project for school and before my eyes she went from angry business owner to helpful South Carolinian and later came to offer the name and telephone number of the man who had installed the very cameras I was researching. The thing that I found the funniest about the situation was that it was the &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; store owner who approached me for not doing something normal. The store, which is named &ldquo;Sid &amp; Nancy&rdquo; after the infamous duo Sid Vicious (bassist for the Sex Pistols) and Nancy Spungen (his girlfriend), functions as a kind of consignment store, selling a variety of things like &ldquo;Space Invader&rdquo; shaped ice trays and worn, torn cowboy boots. The fact alone that one of the stranger stores in town wasn&rsquo;t strange enough for a loitering student outside their doors says a lot about what everyone thinks is &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; (Ewald)</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	<strong>&ldquo;Red Road&rdquo;, and Other Observations</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	While a camera may be an objective observer, it is the eye behind the camera that makes the ultimate interpretation of the images that the camera captures. For instance, in the film Red Road (2006) the protagonist, Jackie, has an army of surveillance cameras at her disposal as an employee of the &ldquo;City Eye.&rdquo; While the camera&rsquo;s gaze seems limitless, Jackie gives value to only certain cameras and those images they capture that she very subjectively identifies to be important. Jackie&rsquo;s interpretation of surveillance, her abuse of it, and what she deems important communicates a very important point about the individual and how they function within a society of constant observation.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	Jackie&rsquo;s job is &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; A sanctioned employee of the city, it is not unusual for her profession to exist. Unlike most people who would be fascinated at the prospect of being able to spy on an entire city, Jackie&rsquo;s job as a surveillance camera operator is completely routine. Francois Ewald writes, &ldquo;The norm finds meaning only in relation to other norms: only a norm can provide a normative value for another norm&rdquo; (153). Thus, while it is abnormal for citizens to effectively &ldquo;spy&rdquo; (a very negative word) on others, Jackie is merely doing her job by &ldquo;watching.&rdquo; She is functioning within the norms of her title as a CCTV operator.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	She watches people as if she is merely turning channels on a television, disconnected from the images through the screen. Until the illusion is broken by a familiar face, she functions&nbsp;as a machine, only bringing attention to images and situations that she decides are noteworthy, based on her personal beliefs and the norms she&rsquo;s been taught to know by society. For example, a school girl getting stabbed in broad day light by her own classmates isn&rsquo;t statistically normal. But then there are personal interpretations that come with what the eye sees, emotional reactions, and questions that arise that the camera simply can&rsquo;t answer. It does ultimately offer only visual information. No more knowledge can be had than what is seen, and so is the life of Jackie, the surveillance camera operator, until she decides to venture out from behind the screen and into the image herself.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	The film, which follows a single observer in between mass observations and personal vendettas of literal stalking, raises not only questions about what society thinks is &ldquo;normal,&rdquo; but also about how individuals react to observation and things that happen outside the &ldquo;standard.&rdquo; Clearly Jackie&rsquo;s growing obsession with only one particular subject is indicative of her abuse of the system. Not only does she neglect to effectively do her job, but when she snags some of the tapes from her office for a second viewing, she does so in secret. Jackie is very aware that she shouldn&rsquo;t be taking the tapes. Her job ends each day at the end of her shift, and thus her privilege to observe the city ends with it. As I discovered in 5-Points, people do not enjoy being watched by unfamiliar eyes. Jackie&rsquo;s sudden lack of objectivity makes her equal almost to a curious observer off the street who is using the system to their personal advantage, whether that be for entertainment or private knowledge. Herein blurs the line between public anonymity and reasonable expectations of privacy as discussed by Christopher Slobogin.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	In the film Jackie lingers on a number of subjects: a cleaning lady dancing to music, a man with his dog, a girl sitting alone on a stoop. Arguably, Jackie should have moved on after</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	briefly observing the dog and his master or the lady dancing in the office. Does her insistence on continuing to view these images break some sort of code? Slobogin argues,</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	CCTV might trigger a number of unsettling emotional consequences&hellip;.Staring, whether it occurs on an elevator, on public transportation, or on the street, violates the rules of &ldquo;civil inattention&rdquo;. The cyclopsian gaze of the camera eye may be equally disquieting, and perhaps more so, given the anonymity of the viewer and the unavailability of normal countermeasures, such as staring back or requesting that the staring cease. (95)</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	The people aren&rsquo;t doing anything wrong. If they knew they were being secretly watched, for no reason other than entertainment purposes, would they feel their rights violated? Yet, surely the citizens must realize the ever presence of the cameras gaze. While they may not be hyper-aware of the prevalence of these security cameras, an innate knowledge is often had that the opportunity for surveillance is very real. Acceptance of this truth, suggests a different kind of public anonymity. Reasonably speaking, the average citizen can expect to be &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo; in public as long as they aren&rsquo;t doing anything outside of the &ldquo;norm,&rdquo; like committing a crime for example. Here, Jackie subjectively unmasks these public individuals and allows them no means of defense or recourse. Arguably, this panoptic reality should be administered more carefully despite the fact that individuals will often not realize their anonymity was being compromised. This aspect of the film reinforces the camera&rsquo;s powerlessness without an active viewer, and further suggests that the eye behind it ultimately determines its overall effectiveness.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	Additionally, the form of the film communicates a very surveillance camera like feel to it. Much like the images captured from a surveillance camera, Jackie is often out of focus, awkwardly placed in the frame, and shown very close up or over the shoulder. The camera seems</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	to follow her in a very realistic way, unlike traditional films where the shots are more seamlessly edited so that the viewer doesn&rsquo;t notice the editing at all. The film is dark and gritty, equal to the narrative in Red Road, and often the protagonist is cast in dark and shadow or the faint glow of a grid-work of television monitors. This uneven approach pushes the viewer back and makes them notice the way the camera captures the images, successfully tying the themes in the film with the literal form of the film itself.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	Overall, Red Road correlates with our project quite literally; each student responsible for their own set of observations very much like Jackie&rsquo;s role as an employee of the &ldquo;City Eye.&rdquo; But are we crossing the line like Jackie did in the film by putting our observations up online? Would it make some of the pedestrians uncomfortable if they knew their every move on Wednesday, June 15th, would be uploaded to a public forum for the entire world to see? Or, is it OK by &ldquo;common standards&rdquo; (Ewald), because in fact we are all recognized and labeled as students, and that&rsquo;s just simply what students are expected and allowed to do?</p>

	<strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The camera next to Sid &amp; Nancy has a long view angle that can record traffic moving along the sidewalk as well as any movement that passes through the alley way towards the back of the shops. The cameras advantage to track so much activity on such a busy street made it ideal for mass observation.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	<strong>Vantage point description:</strong> I sat outdoors, under Delaney&rsquo;s canopy closest to Sid &amp; Nancy and to the right of Delaney&rsquo;s front door. This view gave me access to activity both in front of me (down the sidewalk toward Blossom Street) and behind me (the alley way).</p>

	<strong>Observation:</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:30 &ndash; 80 degrees. Three men stand down the street near the green awning. They are all different ages. The oldest man wears a long sleeved button up striped shirt. It is tucked in. He isn&rsquo;t working. Another man wears reflective sunglasses and a glasses strap, and stands beside the older man. He is younger. Both men wear khakis. The third man wears shorts and a t-shirt, possibly college affiliated, but is probably in his late thirties like the second man.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:35 - The third man uses a staple gun on the fa&ccedil;ade to a building as he stands on a short foot ladder to reach his mark.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:40 &ndash; The third man starts using a caulking gun. I think they are repairing or replacing the fa&ccedil;ade.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:45 &ndash; The man in the reflective glasses still isn&rsquo;t working. He feigns interest. He watches the man work for a bit before walking inside. Both men have left the guy in shorts working alone. He is in the sun.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:50 &ndash; Food service truck &ndash; blocks my view of the street. Pulls up directly in front of Delaney&rsquo;s. Young black man starts to unload it. He wears a blue uniform and shorts. He says &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to me when I look at him. He has disappeared behind the other side of the truck.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:55 &ndash; The lady at Sid &amp; Nancy recognizes me, but I don&rsquo;t recognize her. She&rsquo;s wearing dark sunglasses and a black &ldquo;Ramones&rdquo; tank top. She looked nicer yesterday. She asks me if I know Carey. She offers that he is the &ldquo;guy who installed all the surveillance cameras&rdquo; and I should call him if I need some help.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:56 &ndash; She disappears into her shop and reemerges with her phone and the number. I take it down. She leaves me. I&rsquo;m invisible again!</p>

<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Young white lady. She wears a long flower dress and watches me. She seems to know the men doing construction.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Fat white guy wearing long sleeves and headphones. He walks with a purpose, but doesn&rsquo;t enter any shops.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Lady in the flower dress smokes a cigarette. She also seems to know a bald man on the street.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:05 &ndash; Waitress has feathers in her hair. She starts setting up the chalk board outside. She, too, knows many a passerby. The lady in the flower dress paces between stores while she smokes.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:10 &ndash; The lady in the flower dress doesn&rsquo;t litter. She puts her cigarette out in the bin that&rsquo;s attached to the wall, but she&rsquo;s smoked it to the filter. The waitresses have turned on the fans outside.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:14 &ndash; Intermission &ndash; Check in with Cooley</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:27 - The two non-workers are back. A lady in a red ball cap talks on her cell phone near them. She doesn&rsquo;t have any hair. She crosses the street, out of view.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:30 &ndash; The working man in the shorts and t-shirt leans over his work table. A guy with his lap top walks by. It&rsquo;s tiny! He wears shorts. He walks into the coffee shop, I think.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:32 &ndash; The food truck still hasn&rsquo;t left. A man with a manila envelope walks into the coffee shop. A lady walks out with too coffees. She is young and wears light blue jeans and black scuffed boots.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:35 &ndash; A lady with red hair and an African patterned bag walks by. She wears a long black and tan dress that features a number of geometric shapes all over it. It&rsquo;s very unlike her bag that she carries. She disappears down the street.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:36 &ndash; The food truck man emerges from the back of the truck with a hand truck full of boxes. He wheels it down the alley.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:38 &ndash; A young blonde girl lingers down the side walk while she talks on her cell phone. She talks for a minute and then goes into a store.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:39 &ndash; A black lady examines an article of clothing on the rack outside of one of the stores. She heads inside.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:40 &ndash; I explain &ldquo;BOGO&rdquo; (buy one get one free) to some confused middle-aged people. They walk away from Delaney&rsquo;s sign, unimpressed. They stare in each window they pass as they slowly make their way down the street, examining everything that they see. I get the impression they don&rsquo;t come to 5-Points often.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:41 &ndash; A lady dressed in olive green scrubs walks up the street.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:42 &ndash; The food truck man rolls up his ramp into the back of his truck.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:43 &ndash; The working man starts putting materials that look like molding into the back of his truck, but he doesn&rsquo;t leave. He measures something on the wall.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:44 &ndash; The food service truck drives away.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">

<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:46 &ndash; The working man continues to measure. Flower dress lady steps outside and lights a cigarette. She starts to ask me about my project.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:52 &ndash; The conversation ends.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	What I learned:</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* The majority of the cameras I noted the day before are only about a year old.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* The 5-Points Association paid to have them installed.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* The Association pays a monthly surveillance fee to have them operated and serviced.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Since the city owns the sidewalks, they monitor the cameras when they choose.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* The cameras have been successful apprehending car burglars, purse snatchers, property damagers (Revente once had their window broken in the middle of the night by a drunk kid who was later caught), and street thieves and drunks in general.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* The camera quality is &ldquo;pretty good&rdquo;.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Carey (the guy who installed the cameras) is nice. I should call him. I do. He doesn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:59 &ndash; A couple shows up and sits down two tables from me. The woman has a tan and long brown hair. She&rsquo;s probably in her 40&rsquo;s. The man with her is probably around her age, but he looks younger. He is wearing sunglasses even in the shade of the canopy. I think they&rsquo;re suspicious of me. They both keep looking my direction. They drink Pepsi&rsquo;s.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:02 &ndash; The working man has stopped working. He talks on his cell phone in the shade. A girl in a pink neon skirt walks into a store with a woman who is probably her mom. I don&rsquo;t notice what the mom wears because of how distracted I am by the girls blindingly neon skirt.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:04 - Neon skirt girl is back. She and her mom walk to their car. It&rsquo;s a large black SUV. I notice her mom&rsquo;s clothing for the first time. She wears pink Nike running shorts and tennis shoes. I immediately think of young college students who admire the style. Like her daughter, she wears a fair amount of make-up. I suspect the mom isn&rsquo;t donning the running shorts and tennis shoes to do anything more than shop. They wander aimlessly from store to store.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:08 &ndash; Neon skirt girl and her mom never seemed to have purchased anything. I don&rsquo;t see any bags. They retreat slowly to their car and leave.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:10 &ndash; A lady with full red rolling luggage walks into Delaney&rsquo;s. Her hair looks wet.</p>

	Before even making my way down to the second shop on Saluda on the first day of observation, I was quickly approached by a store owner who was suspicious of my activities outside her door. She had valid reasons for being suspicious of course. No human in their right mind would idle outdoors in Columbia, South Carolina in the middle of the summer and in the heat of the day unless they absolutely had to. Little did she know I absolutely had to, and thus found myself taking notes about the camera fixed on the other side of her shop window, placed high on the wall for pedestrians like myself to observe. That was what they were there for, wasn&rsquo;t it; a visible deterrent? In any event, she came marching out and seemed a bit angry when she accosted me to discover the reason I was loitering outside her door with a notebook. After I apologized (she made it seem like I should), I explained I was working on a project for school and before my eyes she went from angry business owner to helpful South Carolinian and later came to offer the name and telephone number of the man who had installed the very cameras I was researching. The thing that I found the funniest about the situation was that it was the &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; store owner who approached me for not doing something normal. The store, which is named &ldquo;Sid &amp; Nancy&rdquo; after the infamous duo Sid Vicious (bassist for the Sex Pistols) and Nancy Spungen (his girlfriend), functions as a kind of consignment store, selling a variety of things like &ldquo;Space Invader&rdquo; shaped ice trays and worn, torn cowboy boots. The fact alone that one of the stranger stores in town wasn&rsquo;t strange enough for a loitering student outside their doors says a lot about what everyone thinks is &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; (Ewald)</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	<strong>&ldquo;Red Road&rdquo;, and Other Observations</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	While a camera may be an objective observer, it is the eye behind the camera that makes the ultimate interpretation of the images that the camera captures. For instance, in the film Red Road (2006) the protagonist, Jackie, has an army of surveillance cameras at her disposal as an employee of the &ldquo;City Eye.&rdquo; While the camera&rsquo;s gaze seems limitless, Jackie gives value to only certain cameras and those images they capture that she very subjectively identifies to be important. Jackie&rsquo;s interpretation of surveillance, her abuse of it, and what she deems important communicates a very important point about the individual and how they function within a society of constant observation.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	Jackie&rsquo;s job is &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; A sanctioned employee of the city, it is not unusual for her profession to exist. Unlike most people who would be fascinated at the prospect of being able to spy on an entire city, Jackie&rsquo;s job as a surveillance camera operator is completely routine. Francois Ewald writes, &ldquo;The norm finds meaning only in relation to other norms: only a norm can provide a normative value for another norm&rdquo; (153). Thus, while it is abnormal for citizens to effectively &ldquo;spy&rdquo; (a very negative word) on others, Jackie is merely doing her job by &ldquo;watching.&rdquo; She is functioning within the norms of her title as a CCTV operator.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	She watches people as if she is merely turning channels on a television, disconnected from the images through the screen. Until the illusion is broken by a familiar face, she functions&nbsp;as a machine, only bringing attention to images and situations that she decides are noteworthy, based on her personal beliefs and the norms she&rsquo;s been taught to know by society. For example, a school girl getting stabbed in broad day light by her own classmates isn&rsquo;t statistically normal. But then there are personal interpretations that come with what the eye sees, emotional reactions, and questions that arise that the camera simply can&rsquo;t answer. It does ultimately offer only visual information. No more knowledge can be had than what is seen, and so is the life of Jackie, the surveillance camera operator, until she decides to venture out from behind the screen and into the image herself.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	The film, which follows a single observer in between mass observations and personal vendettas of literal stalking, raises not only questions about what society thinks is &ldquo;normal,&rdquo; but also about how individuals react to observation and things that happen outside the &ldquo;standard.&rdquo; Clearly Jackie&rsquo;s growing obsession with only one particular subject is indicative of her abuse of the system. Not only does she neglect to effectively do her job, but when she snags some of the tapes from her office for a second viewing, she does so in secret. Jackie is very aware that she shouldn&rsquo;t be taking the tapes. Her job ends each day at the end of her shift, and thus her privilege to observe the city ends with it. As I discovered in 5-Points, people do not enjoy being watched by unfamiliar eyes. Jackie&rsquo;s sudden lack of objectivity makes her equal almost to a curious observer off the street who is using the system to their personal advantage, whether that be for entertainment or private knowledge. Herein blurs the line between public anonymity and reasonable expectations of privacy as discussed by Christopher Slobogin.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	In the film Jackie lingers on a number of subjects: a cleaning lady dancing to music, a man with his dog, a girl sitting alone on a stoop. Arguably, Jackie should have moved on after</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	briefly observing the dog and his master or the lady dancing in the office. Does her insistence on continuing to view these images break some sort of code? Slobogin argues,</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	CCTV might trigger a number of unsettling emotional consequences&hellip;.Staring, whether it occurs on an elevator, on public transportation, or on the street, violates the rules of &ldquo;civil inattention&rdquo;. The cyclopsian gaze of the camera eye may be equally disquieting, and perhaps more so, given the anonymity of the viewer and the unavailability of normal countermeasures, such as staring back or requesting that the staring cease. (95)</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	The people aren&rsquo;t doing anything wrong. If they knew they were being secretly watched, for no reason other than entertainment purposes, would they feel their rights violated? Yet, surely the citizens must realize the ever presence of the cameras gaze. While they may not be hyper-aware of the prevalence of these security cameras, an innate knowledge is often had that the opportunity for surveillance is very real. Acceptance of this truth, suggests a different kind of public anonymity. Reasonably speaking, the average citizen can expect to be &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo; in public as long as they aren&rsquo;t doing anything outside of the &ldquo;norm,&rdquo; like committing a crime for example. Here, Jackie subjectively unmasks these public individuals and allows them no means of defense or recourse. Arguably, this panoptic reality should be administered more carefully despite the fact that individuals will often not realize their anonymity was being compromised. This aspect of the film reinforces the camera&rsquo;s powerlessness without an active viewer, and further suggests that the eye behind it ultimately determines its overall effectiveness.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	Additionally, the form of the film communicates a very surveillance camera like feel to it. Much like the images captured from a surveillance camera, Jackie is often out of focus, awkwardly placed in the frame, and shown very close up or over the shoulder. The camera seems</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	to follow her in a very realistic way, unlike traditional films where the shots are more seamlessly edited so that the viewer doesn&rsquo;t notice the editing at all. The film is dark and gritty, equal to the narrative in Red Road, and often the protagonist is cast in dark and shadow or the faint glow of a grid-work of television monitors. This uneven approach pushes the viewer back and makes them notice the way the camera captures the images, successfully tying the themes in the film with the literal form of the film itself.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	Overall, Red Road correlates with our project quite literally; each student responsible for their own set of observations very much like Jackie&rsquo;s role as an employee of the &ldquo;City Eye.&rdquo; But are we crossing the line like Jackie did in the film by putting our observations up online? Would it make some of the pedestrians uncomfortable if they knew their every move on Wednesday, June 15th, would be uploaded to a public forum for the entire world to see? Or, is it OK by &ldquo;common standards&rdquo; (Ewald), because in fact we are all recognized and labeled as students, and that&rsquo;s just simply what students are expected and allowed to do?</p>

	<strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The camera next to Sid &amp; Nancy has a long view angle that can record traffic moving along the sidewalk as well as any movement that passes through the alley way towards the back of the shops. The cameras advantage to track so much activity on such a busy street made it ideal for mass observation.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	<strong>Vantage point description:</strong> I sat outdoors, under Delaney&rsquo;s canopy closest to Sid &amp; Nancy and to the right of Delaney&rsquo;s front door. This view gave me access to activity both in front of me (down the sidewalk toward Blossom Street) and behind me (the alley way).</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	<strong>Observation:</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:30 &ndash; 80 degrees. Three men stand down the street near the green awning. They are all different ages. The oldest man wears a long sleeved button up striped shirt. It is tucked in. He isn&rsquo;t working. Another man wears reflective sunglasses and a glasses strap, and stands beside the older man. He is younger. Both men wear khakis. The third man wears shorts and a t-shirt, possibly college affiliated, but is probably in his late thirties like the second man.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:35 - The third man uses a staple gun on the fa&ccedil;ade to a building as he stands on a short foot ladder to reach his mark.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:40 &ndash; The third man starts using a caulking gun. I think they are repairing or replacing the fa&ccedil;ade.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:45 &ndash; The man in the reflective glasses still isn&rsquo;t working. He feigns interest. He watches the man work for a bit before walking inside. Both men have left the guy in shorts working alone. He is in the sun.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:50 &ndash; Food service truck &ndash; blocks my view of the street. Pulls up directly in front of Delaney&rsquo;s. Young black man starts to unload it. He wears a blue uniform and shorts. He says &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to me when I look at him. He has disappeared behind the other side of the truck.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:55 &ndash; The lady at Sid &amp; Nancy recognizes me, but I don&rsquo;t recognize her. She&rsquo;s wearing dark sunglasses and a black &ldquo;Ramones&rdquo; tank top. She looked nicer yesterday. She asks me if I know Carey. She offers that he is the &ldquo;guy who installed all the surveillance cameras&rdquo; and I should call him if I need some help.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:56 &ndash; She disappears into her shop and reemerges with her phone and the number. I take it down. She leaves me. I&rsquo;m invisible again!</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:57 &ndash; The reflective sunglasses guy is back from enjoying the air conditioning.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:58 &ndash; People come and go:</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Young white lady. She wears a long flower dress and watches me. She seems to know the men doing construction.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Fat white guy wearing long sleeves and headphones. He walks with a purpose, but doesn&rsquo;t enter any shops.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Lady in the flower dress smokes a cigarette. She also seems to know a bald man on the street.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:05 &ndash; Waitress has feathers in her hair. She starts setting up the chalk board outside. She, too, knows many a passerby. The lady in the flower dress paces between stores while she smokes.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:10 &ndash; The lady in the flower dress doesn&rsquo;t litter. She puts her cigarette out in the bin that&rsquo;s attached to the wall, but she&rsquo;s smoked it to the filter. The waitresses have turned on the fans outside.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:14 &ndash; Intermission &ndash; Check in with Cooley</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:27 - The two non-workers are back. A lady in a red ball cap talks on her cell phone near them. She doesn&rsquo;t have any hair. She crosses the street, out of view.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:30 &ndash; The working man in the shorts and t-shirt leans over his work table. A guy with his lap top walks by. It&rsquo;s tiny! He wears shorts. He walks into the coffee shop, I think.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:32 &ndash; The food truck still hasn&rsquo;t left. A man with a manila envelope walks into the coffee shop. A lady walks out with too coffees. She is young and wears light blue jeans and black scuffed boots.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:35 &ndash; A lady with red hair and an African patterned bag walks by. She wears a long black and tan dress that features a number of geometric shapes all over it. It&rsquo;s very unlike her bag that she carries. She disappears down the street.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:36 &ndash; The food truck man emerges from the back of the truck with a hand truck full of boxes. He wheels it down the alley.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:38 &ndash; A young blonde girl lingers down the side walk while she talks on her cell phone. She talks for a minute and then goes into a store.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:39 &ndash; A black lady examines an article of clothing on the rack outside of one of the stores. She heads inside.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:40 &ndash; I explain &ldquo;BOGO&rdquo; (buy one get one free) to some confused middle-aged people. They walk away from Delaney&rsquo;s sign, unimpressed. They stare in each window they pass as they slowly make their way down the street, examining everything that they see. I get the impression they don&rsquo;t come to 5-Points often.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:41 &ndash; A lady dressed in olive green scrubs walks up the street.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:42 &ndash; The food truck man rolls up his ramp into the back of his truck.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:43 &ndash; The working man starts putting materials that look like molding into the back of his truck, but he doesn&rsquo;t leave. He measures something on the wall.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:44 &ndash; The food service truck drives away.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11: 45 &ndash; The flower dress lady emerges from one store and walks into Delaney&rsquo;s</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:46 &ndash; The working man continues to measure. Flower dress lady steps outside and lights a cigarette. She starts to ask me about my project.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:52 &ndash; The conversation ends.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	What I learned:</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* The majority of the cameras I noted the day before are only about a year old.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* The 5-Points Association paid to have them installed.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* The Association pays a monthly surveillance fee to have them operated and serviced.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Since the city owns the sidewalks, they monitor the cameras when they choose.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* The cameras have been successful apprehending car burglars, purse snatchers, property damagers (Revente once had their window broken in the middle of the night by a drunk kid who was later caught), and street thieves and drunks in general.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* The camera quality is &ldquo;pretty good&rdquo;.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Carey (the guy who installed the cameras) is nice. I should call him. I do. He doesn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:59 &ndash; A couple shows up and sits down two tables from me. The woman has a tan and long brown hair. She&rsquo;s probably in her 40&rsquo;s. The man with her is probably around her age, but he looks younger. He is wearing sunglasses even in the shade of the canopy. I think they&rsquo;re suspicious of me. They both keep looking my direction. They drink Pepsi&rsquo;s.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:02 &ndash; The working man has stopped working. He talks on his cell phone in the shade. A girl in a pink neon skirt walks into a store with a woman who is probably her mom. I don&rsquo;t notice what the mom wears because of how distracted I am by the girls blindingly neon skirt.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:04 - Neon skirt girl is back. She and her mom walk to their car. It&rsquo;s a large black SUV. I notice her mom&rsquo;s clothing for the first time. She wears pink Nike running shorts and tennis shoes. I immediately think of young college students who admire the style. Like her daughter, she wears a fair amount of make-up. I suspect the mom isn&rsquo;t donning the running shorts and tennis shoes to do anything more than shop. They wander aimlessly from store to store.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:08 &ndash; Neon skirt girl and her mom never seemed to have purchased anything. I don&rsquo;t see any bags. They retreat slowly to their car and leave.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:10 &ndash; A lady with full red rolling luggage walks into Delaney&rsquo;s. Her hair looks wet.</p>

	12:11 &ndash; More people walk by:</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* A fat middle aged man with a goatee sweats as he huffs by.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* A girl pushing a carriage and her mom shopping.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Two friends both wearing large dark sunglasses pass me by.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:14 &ndash; A girl in a mustard-yellow dress gets dropped off by her mom. She drives a Volvo.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:15 &ndash; A young man with his mom walks into Delaney&rsquo;s. He is tall, and wears glasses and tan military style work boots.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:18: A different lady in pink running shorts walks by me for the 5th time. This is the first chance I&rsquo;ve had to write about her. She has blonde hair and no seeming direction.</p>

	12:20: A mother and grandmother help a tiny baby walk into a store. Each woman holds the child by the hand as it wobbles towards the door. It (I can&rsquo;t distinguish its gender from the distance) wears a bright red onesie.</p>

	Before even making my way down to the second shop on Saluda on the first day of observation, I was quickly approached by a store owner who was suspicious of my activities outside her door. She had valid reasons for being suspicious of course. No human in their right mind would idle outdoors in Columbia, South Carolina in the middle of the summer and in the heat of the day unless they absolutely had to. Little did she know I absolutely had to, and thus found myself taking notes about the camera fixed on the other side of her shop window, placed high on the wall for pedestrians like myself to observe. That was what they were there for, wasn&rsquo;t it; a visible deterrent? In any event, she came marching out and seemed a bit angry when she accosted me to discover the reason I was loitering outside her door with a notebook. After I apologized (she made it seem like I should), I explained I was working on a project for school and before my eyes she went from angry business owner to helpful South Carolinian and later came to offer the name and telephone number of the man who had installed the very cameras I was researching. The thing that I found the funniest about the situation was that it was the &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; store owner who approached me for not doing something normal. The store, which is named &ldquo;Sid &amp; Nancy&rdquo; after the infamous duo Sid Vicious (bassist for the Sex Pistols) and Nancy Spungen (his girlfriend), functions as a kind of consignment store, selling a variety of things like &ldquo;Space Invader&rdquo; shaped ice trays and worn, torn cowboy boots. The fact alone that one of the stranger stores in town wasn&rsquo;t strange enough for a loitering student outside their doors says a lot about what everyone thinks is &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; (Ewald)</p>

	<strong>&ldquo;Red Road&rdquo;, and Other Observations</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	While a camera may be an objective observer, it is the eye behind the camera that makes the ultimate interpretation of the images that the camera captures. For instance, in the film <em>Red Road</em> (2006) the protagonist, Jackie, has an army of surveillance cameras at her disposal as an employee of the &ldquo;City Eye.&rdquo; While the camera&rsquo;s gaze seems limitless, Jackie gives value to only certain cameras and those images they capture that she very subjectively identifies to be important. Jackie&rsquo;s interpretation of surveillance, her abuse of it, and what she deems important communicates a very important point about the individual and how they function within a society of constant observation.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	Jackie&rsquo;s job is &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; A sanctioned employee of the city, it is not unusual for her profession to exist. Unlike most people who would be fascinated at the prospect of being able to spy on an entire city, Jackie&rsquo;s job as a surveillance camera operator is completely routine. Francois Ewald writes, &ldquo;The norm finds meaning only in relation to other norms: only a norm can provide a normative value for another norm&rdquo; (153). Thus, while it is abnormal for citizens to effectively &ldquo;spy&rdquo; (a very negative word) on others, Jackie is merely doing her job by &ldquo;watching.&rdquo; She is functioning within the norms of her title as a CCTV operator.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	She watches people as if she is merely turning channels on a television, disconnected from the images through the screen. Until the illusion is broken by a familiar face, she functions&nbsp;as a machine, only bringing attention to images and situations that she decides are noteworthy, based on her personal beliefs and the norms she&rsquo;s been taught to know by society. For example, a school girl getting stabbed in broad day light by her own classmates isn&rsquo;t statistically normal. But then there are personal interpretations that come with what the eye sees, emotional reactions, and questions that arise that the camera simply can&rsquo;t answer. It does ultimately offer only visual information. No more knowledge can be had than what is seen, and so is the life of Jackie, the surveillance camera operator, until she decides to venture out from behind the screen and into the image herself.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	The film, which follows a single observer in between mass observations and personal vendettas of literal stalking, raises not only questions about what society thinks is &ldquo;normal,&rdquo; but also about how individuals react to observation and things that happen outside the &ldquo;standard.&rdquo; Clearly Jackie&rsquo;s growing obsession with only one particular subject is indicative of her abuse of the system. Not only does she neglect to effectively do her job, but when she snags some of the tapes from her office for a second viewing, she does so in secret. Jackie is very aware that she shouldn&rsquo;t be taking the tapes. Her job ends each day at the end of her shift, and thus her privilege to observe the city ends with it. As I discovered in 5-Points, people do not enjoy being watched by unfamiliar eyes. Jackie&rsquo;s sudden lack of objectivity makes her equal almost to a curious observer off the street who is using the system to their personal advantage, whether that be for entertainment or private knowledge. Herein blurs the line between public anonymity and reasonable expectations of privacy as discussed by Christopher Slobogin.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	In the film Jackie lingers on a number of subjects: a cleaning lady dancing to music, a man with his dog, a girl sitting alone on a stoop. Arguably, Jackie should have moved on after&nbsp;briefly observing the dog and his master or the lady dancing in the office. Does her insistence on continuing to view these images break some sort of code? Slobogin argues,</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	<cite>CCTV might trigger a number of unsettling emotional consequences&hellip;.Staring, whether it occurs on an elevator, on public transportation, or on the street, violates the rules of &ldquo;civil inattention&rdquo;. The cyclopsian gaze of the camera eye may be equally disquieting, and perhaps more so, given the anonymity of the viewer and the unavailability of normal countermeasures, such as staring back or requesting that the staring cease. (95)</cite></p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	The people aren&rsquo;t doing anything wrong. If they knew they were being secretly watched, for no reason other than entertainment purposes, would they feel their rights violated? Yet, surely the citizens must realize the ever presence of the cameras gaze. While they may not be hyper-aware of the prevalence of these security cameras, an innate knowledge is often had that the opportunity for surveillance is very real. Acceptance of this truth, suggests a different kind of public anonymity. Reasonably speaking, the average citizen can expect to be &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo; in public as long as they aren&rsquo;t doing anything outside of the &ldquo;norm,&rdquo; like committing a crime for example. Here, Jackie subjectively unmasks these public individuals and allows them no means of defense or recourse. Arguably, this panoptic reality should be administered more carefully despite the fact that individuals will often not realize their anonymity was being compromised. This aspect of the film reinforces the camera&rsquo;s powerlessness without an active viewer, and further suggests that the eye behind it ultimately determines its overall effectiveness.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	Additionally, the form of the film communicates a very surveillance camera like feel to it. Much like the images captured from a surveillance camera, Jackie is often out of focus, awkwardly placed in the frame, and shown very close up or over the shoulder. The camera seems&nbsp;to follow her in a very realistic way, unlike traditional films where the shots are more seamlessly edited so that the viewer doesn&rsquo;t notice the editing at all. The film is dark and gritty, equal to the narrative in Red Road, and often the protagonist is cast in dark and shadow or the faint glow of a grid-work of television monitors. This uneven approach pushes the viewer back and makes them notice the way the camera captures the images, successfully tying the themes in the film with the literal form of the film itself.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	Overall, <em>Red Road</em> correlates with our project quite literally; each student responsible for their own set of observations very much like Jackie&rsquo;s role as an employee of the &ldquo;City Eye.&rdquo; But are we crossing the line like Jackie did in the film by putting our observations up online? Would it make some of the pedestrians uncomfortable if they knew their every move on Wednesday, June 15th, would be uploaded to a public forum for the entire world to see? Or, is it OK by &ldquo;common standards&rdquo; (Ewald), because in fact we are all recognized and labeled as students, and that&rsquo;s just simply what students are expected and allowed to do?</p>

	<strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The camera next to Sid &amp; Nancy has a long view angle that can record traffic moving along the sidewalk as well as any movement that passes through the alley way towards the back of the shops. The cameras advantage to track so much activity on such a busy street made it ideal for mass observation.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	<strong>Vantage point description:</strong> I sat outdoors, under Delaney&rsquo;s canopy closest to Sid &amp; Nancy and to the right of Delaney&rsquo;s front door. This view gave me access to activity both in front of me (down the sidewalk toward Blossom Street) and behind me (the alley way).</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	<strong>Observation:</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:30 &ndash; 80 degrees. Three men stand down the street near the green awning. They are all different ages. The oldest man wears a long sleeved button up striped shirt. It is tucked in. He isn&rsquo;t working. Another man wears reflective sunglasses and a glasses strap, and stands beside the older man. He is younger. Both men wear khakis. The third man wears shorts and a t-shirt, possibly college affiliated, but is probably in his late thirties like the second man.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:35 - The third man uses a staple gun on the fa&ccedil;ade to a building as he stands on a short foot ladder to reach his mark.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:40 &ndash; The third man starts using a caulking gun. I think they are repairing or replacing the fa&ccedil;ade.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:45 &ndash; The man in the reflective glasses still isn&rsquo;t working. He feigns interest. He watches the man work for a bit before walking inside. Both men have left the guy in shorts working alone. He is in the sun.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:50 &ndash; Food service truck &ndash; blocks my view of the street. Pulls up directly in front of Delaney&rsquo;s. Young black man starts to unload it. He wears a blue uniform and shorts. He says &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to me when I look at him. He has disappeared behind the other side of the truck.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:55 &ndash; The lady at Sid &amp; Nancy recognizes me, but I don&rsquo;t recognize her. She&rsquo;s wearing dark sunglasses and a black &ldquo;Ramones&rdquo; tank top. She looked nicer yesterday. She asks me if I know Carey. She offers that he is the &ldquo;guy who installed all the surveillance cameras&rdquo; and I should call him if I need some help.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:56 &ndash; She disappears into her shop and reemerges with her phone and the number. I take it down. She leaves me. I&rsquo;m invisible again!</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:57 &ndash; The reflective sunglasses guy is back from enjoying the air conditioning.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	10:58 &ndash; People come and go:</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Young white lady. She wears a long flower dress and watches me. She seems to know the men doing construction.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Fat white guy wearing long sleeves and headphones. He walks with a purpose, but doesn&rsquo;t enter any shops.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Lady in the flower dress smokes a cigarette. She also seems to know a bald man on the street.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:05 &ndash; Waitress has feathers in her hair. She starts setting up the chalk board outside. She, too, knows many a passerby. The lady in the flower dress paces between stores while she smokes.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:10 &ndash; The lady in the flower dress doesn&rsquo;t litter. She puts her cigarette out in the bin that&rsquo;s attached to the wall, but she&rsquo;s smoked it to the filter. The waitresses have turned on the fans outside.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:14 &ndash; Intermission &ndash; Check in with Cooley</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:27 - The two non-workers are back. A lady in a red ball cap talks on her cell phone near them. She doesn&rsquo;t have any hair. She crosses the street, out of view.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:30 &ndash; The working man in the shorts and t-shirt leans over his work table. A guy with his lap top walks by. It&rsquo;s tiny! He wears shorts. He walks into the coffee shop, I think.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:32 &ndash; The food truck still hasn&rsquo;t left. A man with a manila envelope walks into the coffee shop. A lady walks out with too coffees. She is young and wears light blue jeans and black scuffed boots.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:35 &ndash; A lady with red hair and an African patterned bag walks by. She wears a long black and tan dress that features a number of geometric shapes all over it. It&rsquo;s very unlike her bag that she carries. She disappears down the street.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:36 &ndash; The food truck man emerges from the back of the truck with a hand truck full of boxes. He wheels it down the alley.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:38 &ndash; A young blonde girl lingers down the side walk while she talks on her cell phone. She talks for a minute and then goes into a store.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:39 &ndash; A black lady examines an article of clothing on the rack outside of one of the stores. She heads inside.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:40 &ndash; I explain &ldquo;BOGO&rdquo; (buy one get one free) to some confused middle-aged people. They walk away from Delaney&rsquo;s sign, unimpressed. They stare in each window they pass as they slowly make their way down the street, examining everything that they see. I get the impression they don&rsquo;t come to 5-Points often.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:41 &ndash; A lady dressed in olive green scrubs walks up the street.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:42 &ndash; The food truck man rolls up his ramp into the back of his truck.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:43 &ndash; The working man starts putting materials that look like molding into the back of his truck, but he doesn&rsquo;t leave. He measures something on the wall.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:44 &ndash; The food service truck drives away.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11: 45 &ndash; The flower dress lady emerges from one store and walks into Delaney&rsquo;s</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:46 &ndash; The working man continues to measure. Flower dress lady steps outside and lights a cigarette. She starts to ask me about my project.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:52 &ndash; The conversation ends.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	What I learned:</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* The majority of the cameras I noted the day before are only about a year old.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* The 5-Points Association paid to have them installed.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* The Association pays a monthly surveillance fee to have them operated and serviced.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Since the city owns the sidewalks, they monitor the cameras when they choose.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* The cameras have been successful apprehending car burglars, purse snatchers, property damagers (Revente once had their window broken in the middle of the night by a drunk kid who was later caught), and street thieves and drunks in general.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* The camera quality is &ldquo;pretty good&rdquo;.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Carey (the guy who installed the cameras) is nice. I should call him. I do. He doesn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	11:59 &ndash; A couple shows up and sits down two tables from me. The woman has a tan and long brown hair. She&rsquo;s probably in her 40&rsquo;s. The man with her is probably around her age, but he looks younger. He is wearing sunglasses even in the shade of the canopy. I think they&rsquo;re suspicious of me. They both keep looking my direction. They drink Pepsi&rsquo;s.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:02 &ndash; The working man has stopped working. He talks on his cell phone in the shade. A girl in a pink neon skirt walks into a store with a woman who is probably her mom. I don&rsquo;t notice what the mom wears because of how distracted I am by the girls blindingly neon skirt.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:04 - Neon skirt girl is back. She and her mom walk to their car. It&rsquo;s a large black SUV. I notice her mom&rsquo;s clothing for the first time. She wears pink Nike running shorts and tennis shoes. I immediately think of young college students who admire the style. Like her daughter, she wears a fair amount of make-up. I suspect the mom isn&rsquo;t donning the running shorts and tennis shoes to do anything more than shop. They wander aimlessly from store to store.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:08 &ndash; Neon skirt girl and her mom never seemed to have purchased anything. I don&rsquo;t see any bags. They retreat slowly to their car and leave.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:10 &ndash; A lady with full red rolling luggage walks into Delaney&rsquo;s. Her hair looks wet.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:11 &ndash; More people walk by:</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* A fat middle aged man with a goatee sweats as he huffs by.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* A girl pushing a carriage and her mom shopping.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	* Two friends both wearing large dark sunglasses pass me by.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:14 &ndash; A girl in a mustard-yellow dress gets dropped off by her mom. She drives a Volvo.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:15 &ndash; A young man with his mom walks into Delaney&rsquo;s. He is tall, and wears glasses and tan military style work boots.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:18: A different lady in pink running shorts walks by me for the 5th time. This is the first chance I&rsquo;ve had to write about her. She has blonde hair and no seeming direction.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:20: A mother and grandmother help a tiny baby walk into a store. Each woman holds the child by the hand as it wobbles towards the door. It (I can&rsquo;t distinguish its gender from the distance) wears a bright red onesie.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	12:22: The waitress distracts me with the menu. She brings more Pepsi to the couple sitting a few tables down from me. They aren&rsquo;t talking.</p>

	Before even making my way down to the second shop on Saluda on the first day of observation, I was quickly approached by a store owner who was suspicious of my activities outside her door. She had valid reasons for being suspicious of course. No human in their right mind would idle outdoors in Columbia, South Carolina in the middle of the summer and in the heat of the day unless they absolutely had to. Little did she know I absolutely had to, and thus found myself taking notes about the camera fixed on the other side of her shop window, placed high on the wall for pedestrians like myself to observe. That was what they were there for, wasn&rsquo;t it; a visible deterrent? In any event, she came marching out and seemed a bit angry when she accosted me to discover the reason I was loitering outside her door with a notebook. After I apologized (she made it seem like I should), I explained I was working on a project for school and before my eyes she went from angry business owner to helpful South Carolinian and later came to offer the name and telephone number of the man who had installed the very cameras I was researching. The thing that I found the funniest about the situation was that it was the &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; store owner who approached me for not doing something normal. The store, which is named &ldquo;Sid &amp; Nancy&rdquo; after the infamous duo Sid Vicious (bassist for the Sex Pistols) and Nancy Spungen (his girlfriend), functions as a kind of consignment store, selling a variety of things like &ldquo;Space Invader&rdquo; shaped ice trays and worn, torn cowboy boots. The fact alone that one of the stranger stores in town wasn&rsquo;t strange enough for a loitering student outside their doors says a lot about what everyone thinks is &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; (Ewald)</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	<strong>&ldquo;Red Road&rdquo;, and Other Observations</strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	While a camera may be an objective observer, it is the eye behind the camera that makes the ultimate interpretation of the images that the camera captures. For instance, in the film <em>Red Road</em> (2006) the protagonist, Jackie, has an army of surveillance cameras at her disposal as an employee of the &ldquo;City Eye.&rdquo; While the camera&rsquo;s gaze seems limitless, Jackie gives value to only certain cameras and those images they capture that she very subjectively identifies to be important. Jackie&rsquo;s interpretation of surveillance, her abuse of it, and what she deems important communicates a very important point about the individual and how they function within a society of constant observation.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	Jackie&rsquo;s job is &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; A sanctioned employee of the city, it is not unusual for her profession to exist. Unlike most people who would be fascinated at the prospect of being able to spy on an entire city, Jackie&rsquo;s job as a surveillance camera operator is completely routine. Francois Ewald writes, &ldquo;The norm finds meaning only in relation to other norms: only a norm can provide a normative value for another norm&rdquo; (153). Thus, while it is abnormal for citizens to effectively &ldquo;spy&rdquo; (a very negative word) on others, Jackie is merely doing her job by &ldquo;watching.&rdquo; She is functioning within the norms of her title as a CCTV operator.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	She watches people as if she is merely turning channels on a television, disconnected from the images through the screen. Until the illusion is broken by a familiar face, she functions&nbsp;as a machine, only bringing attention to images and situations that she decides are noteworthy, based on her personal beliefs and the norms she&rsquo;s been taught to know by society. For example, a school girl getting stabbed in broad day light by her own classmates isn&rsquo;t statistically normal. But then there are personal interpretations that come with what the eye sees, emotional reactions, and questions that arise that the camera simply can&rsquo;t answer. It does ultimately offer only visual information. No more knowledge can be had than what is seen, and so is the life of Jackie, the surveillance camera operator, until she decides to venture out from behind the screen and into the image herself.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	The film, which follows a single observer in between mass observations and personal vendettas of literal stalking, raises not only questions about what society thinks is &ldquo;normal,&rdquo; but also about how individuals react to observation and things that happen outside the &ldquo;standard.&rdquo; Clearly Jackie&rsquo;s growing obsession with only one particular subject is indicative of her abuse of the system. Not only does she neglect to effectively do her job, but when she snags some of the tapes from her office for a second viewing, she does so in secret. Jackie is very aware that she shouldn&rsquo;t be taking the tapes. Her job ends each day at the end of her shift, and thus her privilege to observe the city ends with it. As I discovered in 5-Points, people do not enjoy being watched by unfamiliar eyes. Jackie&rsquo;s sudden lack of objectivity makes her equal almost to a curious observer off the street who is using the system to their personal advantage, whether that be for entertainment or private knowledge. Herein blurs the line between public anonymity and reasonable expectations of privacy as discussed by Christopher Slobogin.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	In the film Jackie lingers on a number of subjects: a cleaning lady dancing to music, a man with his dog, a girl sitting alone on a stoop. Arguably, Jackie should have moved on after&nbsp;briefly observing the dog and his master or the lady dancing in the office. Does her insistence on continuing to view these images break some sort of code? Slobogin argues,</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	<cite>CCTV might trigger a number of unsettling emotional consequences&hellip;.Staring, whether it occurs on an elevator, on public transportation, or on the street, violates the rules of &ldquo;civil inattention&rdquo;. The cyclopsian gaze of the camera eye may be equally disquieting, and perhaps more so, given the anonymity of the viewer and the unavailability of normal countermeasures, such as staring back or requesting that the staring cease. (95)</cite></p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	The people aren&rsquo;t doing anything wrong. If they knew they were being secretly watched, for no reason other than entertainment purposes, would they feel their rights violated? Yet, surely the citizens must realize the ever presence of the cameras gaze. While they may not be hyper-aware of the prevalence of these security cameras, an innate knowledge is often had that the opportunity for surveillance is very real. Acceptance of this truth, suggests a different kind of public anonymity. Reasonably speaking, the average citizen can expect to be &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo; in public as long as they aren&rsquo;t doing anything outside of the &ldquo;norm,&rdquo; like committing a crime for example. Here, Jackie subjectively unmasks these public individuals and allows them no means of defense or recourse. Arguably, this panoptic reality should be administered more carefully despite the fact that individuals will often not realize their anonymity was being compromised. This aspect of the film reinforces the camera&rsquo;s powerlessness without an active viewer, and further suggests that the eye behind it ultimately determines its overall effectiveness.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	Additionally, the form of the film communicates a very surveillance camera like feel to it. Much like the images captured from a surveillance camera, Jackie is often out of focus, awkwardly placed in the frame, and shown very close up or over the shoulder. The camera seems&nbsp;to follow her in a very realistic way, unlike traditional films where the shots are more seamlessly edited so that the viewer doesn&rsquo;t notice the editing at all. The film is dark and gritty, equal to the narrative in Red Road, and often the protagonist is cast in dark and shadow or the faint glow of a grid-work of television monitors. This uneven approach pushes the viewer back and makes them notice the way the camera captures the images, successfully tying the themes in the film with the literal form of the film itself.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium; "">
	Overall, <em>Red Road</em> correlates with our project quite literally; each student responsible for their own set of observations very much like Jackie&rsquo;s role as an employee of the &ldquo;City Eye.&rdquo; But are we crossing the line like Jackie did in the film by putting our observations up online? Would it make some of the pedestrians uncomfortable if they knew their every move on Wednesday, June 15th, would be uploaded to a public forum for the entire world to see? Or, is it OK by &ldquo;common standards&rdquo; (Ewald), because in fact we are all recognized and labeled as students, and that&rsquo;s just simply what students are expected and allowed to do?</p>

	Hiding In Public</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	On Wednesday June 15<sup>th</sup> from 10:30 a.m. &ndash; 12:30 p.m. I observed a surveillance camera in <a href=""http://www.cafecarolina.com/"">Carolina Caf&eacute;</a> at 925 Sumter Street,&nbsp;Columbia, SC 29201. This camera was positioned exactly over the door pointed straight ahead. The camera I chose in relation to the seat I chose to sit in had the best view of the four-way intersection, the door and the counter. The only traffic I had behind me was people using the restroom, which was far less busy than the front door traffic.</p>
<p>

<p>
	This is a map of the general area of Carolina Caf&eacute;. I watched the camera on the far left for the duration of the project. Along with this camera are a couple of others in near sight and the collection of the cameras focus on one general area. The area is highlighted in blue where most of the action goes on in the caf&eacute; and the business makes sure they have plenty of surveillance from various angles. This is great in case of a robbery since the food products and cash register are in this vicinity. Not only robberies are the main focus, employee misconduct such as theft is key for the location of the cameras.</p>
<p>

<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This still photograph shows the central location of the camera. If it were to catch a revealing act such as theft or any type of crime, it would be easy to reveal it to the public and the authorities, but we tend not to notice. Grusin describes a consequence of this sense of normalcy. There is a normalcy of being imaged all the time. We&rsquo;re not startled or surprised by cameras anymore. We ourselves, take pictures all the time. In his <em>Affect and Mediality</em> after 9/11 he states, &ldquo;They came into existence through ordinary media practices &ndash; taking digital photographs, burning them on CDs, uploading them on websites, and emailing them to friends and family &ndash; that were a piece with our own everyday media practices of photographing our pets, our vacations, or our loved ones, and then sharing these images with friends, family, or strangers via the same media of file sharing, email, social networking, mobile phones, and the web&hellip;&rdquo; (Grusin) However, in the case of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0896866/""><em>Standard Operating Procedure</em></a>, the person who began to take the photographs wanted to bring the Abu Ghraib situation to the public. In the back of her mind she was aware of the possibility that someone would be reprimanded, but not to the extent that everyone was punished. She&rsquo;s aware of taking pictures, but she doesn&rsquo;t realize what Grusin does. That it is normal to take pictures and in most instances automatically reach for a camera.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	As a whole this experiment consisted of me surveying the area surrounding the Carolina Caf&eacute; on the block of Main/Sumter/College/Pendleton streets. During this observation I found that cameras are almost non-existent. Other than ATMs and emergency poles located all across campus, this is the only camera easily visible from the street. Cameras may very well be in discrete locations on this block and would be good for safety reasons. I was surprised that the Byrnes building seemed not to have exterior cameras. The public could hold a state of anonymity on this block opposed to many blocks in downtown Columbia that are filled with cameras following your every move. In <em>How Little We Know of Our Neighbors </em>by Rebecca Baron there was almost no instance of public anonymity. In London when an average person is photographed 300 times a day with one camera for every 14 people, it is difficult to hide and remain anonymous in public.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	I assumed there would be a camera with a bird&rsquo;s eye view looking down on the corner for Sumter and College streets overlooking the Horseshoe. The Horseshoe is historic on the campus of the University of South Carolina because it was part of the original 1801 campus. Being the tallest building in the area, I assumed it would have cameras at various points, street level and aerial. This could be great for safety considering the traffic going through this area during school.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	During the actual experiment on day two I was relatively hiding in public because there were no disturbances with my observation time, while some of my classmates didn&rsquo;t have such luck. I kept to myself at a little table writing down every last detail about the customers, workers, and every person in or around the caf&eacute;. A sense of normalcy would be the best way to describe this project. No one approached me wondering what I was doing or why I had been there for so long without someone keeping me company. Nothing out of the ordinary occurred and people minded their business and went about their days in an average manner.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The sense of normalcy during the mass observation was anything but accidental. I walked into the caf&eacute; to order a muffin and a drink, which is considered normal for breakfast time at 10:30 a.m. Doing this it was almost as if I disarmed any worker or owner that could have been skeptical of a guy walking into a store strictly taking notes of the surroundings for two full hours. I did this not only to &ldquo;fit-in&rdquo;, but also to avoid any further problems if they happened to ask me to leave. Francois Ewald states, &ldquo;Normalization, then, is less a question of making products conform to a standard model than it is of reaching an understanding with regard to the choice of a model&hellip;Normalization is thus the production of norms, standards for measurement and comparison, and rules of judgment.&rdquo; (Ewald) The &ldquo;normal&rdquo; model would be a customer that walks in a caf&eacute; and makes a purchase. The understanding with regard would be the person recognizing they have made a choice to conform to this model rather than go astray by disregarding the standards for measurement and comparison.</p>

	<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Peek-A-Boo</p>
<p>
	During an individual&rsquo;s youth, we grow up on playing games where we have to search for an individual. With games such as hide and seek, peek-a-boo, tag, and so forth, we determine at a young age to hide and spot one another. We then encounter what our behaviours might be. Next, we learn what traits are common and acceptable from these occurrences. As we grow older, we still tend to notice details about each other. Therefore, it comes to no surprise that I would later see this trend in academic studies.<br />
	&nbsp;On June 15, 2011, I was in search for a surveillance camera, in order to observe and note the behaviours of people passing by the device, for a class project. After searching far and wide, I finally found the camera most suitable for this experiment. The camera I chose to observe was located at the Russell House West Wing (1400 Greene Street in Columbia, South Carolina). The following day, I sat near the surveillance camera and let my observations begin.<br />
	The model of the camera was a white, Ipela manufactured by Sony. This model is unusual; it does not conform to typical notions of surveillance cameras. The camera is housed inside a glass container and looked more like a street light than a camera. Its disguise might easily dupe anyone who glanced at it. The signs of surveillance were visible, but the camera could easily be mistaken. This could be the reason why most of the people passing by seemed nonchalant. <img alt="""" class=""ibimage"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/3.jpg"" style=""width: 336px; height: 448px;"" /><br />
	&nbsp;The placement of the camera is above a door frame and seems capable of rotating to capture more than one view or scenery. The reason I selected this particular camera is because of there being quite a bit of activity going on in the surrounding area. To someone who may not know and get a better feel of how the building looked, which the camera was located outside of, would mostly resemble a hallway of sorts. In other words, the building was small and narrow. The entrance leads straight to the exit. However, there are a few rooms inside. The surveillance camera&rsquo;s purpose was to monitor the surrounding area outside the building and to keep any suspicious behaviour from going on.<br />
	Many people passed by the camera throughout the time of observation. Being between the library and main campus, it is a site of fairly constant traffic. In addition, there seemed to be orientation for upcoming students going on nearby and employees maintaining care of the lawn.<br />
	There weren&rsquo;t many cases of suspicious activity going on, but there may have been reason behind this. Christopher Slobogin explains, &ldquo;People who engage in expressive conduct in public know they will be observed&rdquo; (Slobogin 101). However, most seemed as if they were going on about their day and didn&rsquo;t seem to notice the camera.<br />
	A common trend I noticed about people passing by the camera and going inside the door below the camera, was that they seemed to be looking down and messing with their phone. Albert-L&aacute;szl&oacute; Barab&aacute;si states, &ldquo;time-stamped information about our phone conversations sits in our phone company&rsquo;s vast hard drives&rdquo; (Barab&aacute;si 10). Therefore, in actuality, these people were being observed numerous times. James B. Rule speaks on the subject, by stating, &ldquo;many users seem not to know it, cell phones, when turned on, have the potential to track their users&rsquo; movements&rdquo; (Rule 175). Furthermore, Barab&aacute;si explains, &ldquo;Indeed, mobile-phone carriers record our location only when we actually are on call&rdquo; (Barab&aacute;si 196). Likewise, people coming out of the door didn&rsquo;t seem to notice the camera at all.<br />
	Three people drew my attention. One: a man turned his head away from the camera, and then put on sunglasses. After he passed the camera he turned his head back around. Two: a man, who was talking on his phone, used the sign in front of the camera to scratch his back (he had no free hands). I found this incident amusing. Three: a woman seemed to take a glance at the camera, looked at the door, and then walked away. This was the only instance I counted where someone did seem to notice the camera.<br />
	&nbsp;My observation took place at a table near the camera. I tried to sit in the shade as to avoid discomfort during the observation. My choice of location was good, because I had a clear look at each individual&rsquo;s movements and expressions.<img alt="""" class=""ibimage"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/1.jpg"" style=""width: 336px; height: 448px;"" /><br />
	&nbsp;As I sat at the table, I started noticing particularities about the camera&rsquo;s location. The reason for it being placed so high up is probably to capture and overlook a wide range of activity and to look over the bushes that surround it. Also, the placement may have been to overlook the bike racks for bike theft. It could possibly even be for robbers in the building looking for a quick getaway, who may be travelling by bike than on foot.<br />
	&nbsp;However, one thing seemed a bit strange. There was a camera above the front door, but there was no camera above the back door. I would have to question this approach, because it seems there should be two, for security issues, in both the entrance and exit. I have since learned there is indeed a camera in the back courtyard hiding amidst the branches of trees. This camera also resembles a street light, which is the main reason I had a hard time noticing it. The reason this camera wasn&rsquo;t placed above the back door frame may be due to the library being nearby. The placement could monitor a wider range, possibly stretching out to the library, than if it were placed anywhere else.&nbsp; However, the resemblance of the streetlight seems strange, because it seems as if the reason for the cameras being there are for people to take notice so that they wouldn&rsquo;t do any shady activity.<img alt="""" class=""ibimage"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/4.jpg"" style=""width: 336px; height: 448px;"" /><br />
	<br />
	The task of trying to go unnoticed, as to providing a more accurate observation, went pretty easily for me. It seemed as if everyone saw me as another student concentrating on school work, which in part is actually what I was doing. However, most didn&rsquo;t notice the fact that I was actually observing the surrounding area and their behaviours. In fact, one woman asked me for directions and another group asked me to join their study group. Both cases made me feel as if they were unaware of what I was doing and that I was approachable enough to ask questions without feeling threatened. Therefore, the task of trying to blend in was successful.<br />
	At some point during my observation, I became attuned to the work of the surveillance camera. The project started to become more personal to me. It made me feel like if the camera was a living being, then I would know how it felt, hypothetically speaking of course. That is to say, I felt like a surveillance camera with all the observing I was doing.<br />
	&nbsp;The whole ordeal reminds me of a screening of the film <em>Red Road</em> (2006). The main character, Jackie, works as a surveillance camera operator. During her job she would monitor the television sets overlooking what was going on in the streets. Later in the film she notices a man. She would then concentrate on that one specific individual throughout the film. However, the difference in my case was I concentrated on many individuals at different instances.<br />
	Overall, the experience raised questions for me. What was the reason for the majority of the people I observed acting so casually? Is it because we as individuals are immune to having some sense of being watched? If one thinks about it, we are constantly being watched every time we step out in public. Throughout each and everyday, we take notice of what people are doing. This can be instances of chatting with someone, working, or driving your car. Whether we realize it or not, even if it may be for a moment, we are being recognized. Rule states, &ldquo;Once most people grow inured to monitoring as a normal feature of everyday life, a total surveillance world would work much more smoothly than any alternative&rdquo; (Rule 181). Considering all the technology available to us, I would have to say that time is approaching. However, Rule brings up another important aspect. Rule explains, &ldquo;But a world totally without privacy, and hence without the possibility of individual innovation or resistance to authority, would lack something essential&rdquo; (Rule 187).<br />
	The project made me take notice of how we are all like surveillance cameras as well. I&rsquo;m sure we can count times when we&rsquo;ve observed certain individuals. If we detect some sort of unusual behaviour, we tend to avoid the situation or come up with a solution to fix the problem. This is the purpose of a surveillance camera, to fix problems. Therefore, the experience did give new insights dealing with surveillance and common behaviours. I realized due to the nature of the project and unsuspicious activity, that most people do seem to be a bit cautious of how they handle themselves.</p>

	In early 2008, New Zealand&rsquo;s Victoria University submitted a proposal to merge its Film Studies department into a new school of &ldquo;Visual Culture&rdquo;. The proposal, which advocated the convergence of disciplines in the name of inter-disciplinary creativity, was heavily criticised by both staff and students, and was dismissed shortly after. The following year, the New Zealand government announced in its yearly budget that Victoria University&rsquo;s humanities faculty would lose $800,000NZD of funding (while the sciences enjoyed a 2.3 million dollar bump). Then, in December 2011, the university, under the guidance of an appointed working party, agreed to dismantle its Gender and Women&rsquo;s studies program (effective semester one 2011). Each of these events, for which there are numerous examples at New Zealand universities and abroad, are symptomatic of an ongoing crisis for humanities faculties around the world. Specifically, these examples signal the extension of the neoliberal paradigm and market logic into the university. However, this narrativebegins to frame such a crisis at the level of the institution and its government. What it elidesare the technologies of the self, and the conditions in which students themselves are encouraged to construct branded identities. Here, we offer a local account of New Zealand&rsquo;s higher education structures from the perspective of the student, arguing that this branding of the self folds back into university departments, as a result of their responsibility to facilitate this branding process through the adoption of a &lsquo;service&rsquo; logic. In turn, this process produces, and re-produces, the discursive networks that mediate the relationship between students and humanities programmes.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Prospective students in New Zealand, as in any other part of the world, are faced with a choice of direction in the type of study they wish to undertake, which is part of a much larger formation of selfhood. The discourse of personal transformation has always been part of higher education, from the stereotypical freshman to the mature student: both are entrenched in a journey to, as academics James Cot&eacute; and Anton Allahar put it, either &ldquo;find oneself&rdquo; or &ldquo;better oneself&rdquo; as &ldquo;architects of their own destiny&rdquo; (110). However, the rise of what Alison Hearn (2010) has termed &lsquo;the promotional&rsquo; (and distinctly neoliberal) university brings with it a language of personal responsibility, and a mentality dictated by market logic, where the journey of becoming is much more narrowly defined&mdash;that is, to pursue a career. In July of last year, New Zealand&rsquo;s Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce outlined the centre-right National Party-led Government&rsquo;s plan to directly link tertiary education funding to vocational output targets in a statement, which exemplifies neoliberal attitudes in the contemporary climate:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:36.0pt;"">
	I want to see funding linked to employment outcomes, not just internal benchmarks. This will send a strong signal to students about which qualifications and which institutions offer the best career prospects. And that&rsquo;s what tertiary education has got to be about (Binning).</p>
<p style=""margin-left:36.0pt;"">
<img alt="""" class=""ibimage"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/joyce.jpg"" style=""width: 302px; height: 262px; "" /></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"" />
<p>
	The message is clear, both in its objectives, but also in what is omitted. If university&rsquo;s primary role is the production of an educated workforce, then its traditional ability to function as a necessarily external space for the production of knowledge, and with a responsibility for societal critique, is clearly being eroded.</p>
<p>
	<strong>The Self-Branded Student and the &lsquo;Service&rsquo; Logic</strong></p>
<p>
	As external bodies stress the importance for vocational outputs from higher education (in New Zealand this is as much a part of public discourse as it is a governmental priority), students are not only fed the idea that universities are, in the words of Derek McCormack (chairman of New Zealand&rsquo;s Vice Chancellors&rsquo; Committee), becoming &ldquo;more and more like an employment agency&rdquo; (Beaumont), but furthermore, are warned of an increasingly competitive job market. The bottom line, we are told, is that graduates need to seek opportunities which will help them to &lsquo;stand above the crowd&rsquo;. One response is the construction of a self-brand, what Anothony Giddens calls &lsquo;the reflexive project of the self&rsquo;, which condenses a student&rsquo;s university experience into one aspect of a much larger personal branding project. Here, the self becomes a commodity, which is self-consciously produced via a series of &lsquo;meta-narratives&rsquo; and &lsquo;meta-images&rsquo; of the self-as-brand, &ldquo;through the use of cultural meanings and images drawn from narrative and visual codes of the mainstream culture industries&rdquo; (Hearn 197). By this logic, brands do not simply exist in a one-to-one relationship to their commodity referent, they also function as part of a wider visual context for consumption, where the brand becomes a locus for the mediation between the brander and the consumer (Hearn 2011).</p>
<p>
<img alt="""" class=""ibimage"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/personal_branding.jpg"" style=""width: 934px; height: 292px; "" /></p>
<p>
	The relationship between the brander and the brand gestures outwards, as a particular discourse informing the individual&rsquo;s relationship with the institution of the university, which is perceived as the provider of a service. In this model, students start to appear as autonomous &lsquo;choosers&rsquo;, perceiving education as what Hearn calls a &ldquo;zero-sum game, where they get [in the form of grades] what they pay for [in the form of capital or fees]&rdquo; (2010: 205). This upsets the hegemonic discourse of academia, where teaching staff are privileged as the sanctified purveyors of knowledge, and students are placed in the subordinate position of the relatively unknowledgeable learner. Under the neoliberal paradigm, lecturers are viewed as the providers of a service, while the individual, self-branding student perceives themself at the centre of a network of power-relations, which is heavily informed by the distinct logics of the marketplace. The end result is a pair of competing discourses: between the views of academic staff, and the new expectations of the self-branding students</p>
<p>
	The external representation of the branded self is the CV, a site where the various expressions of the personal brand are gathered for viewing and consumption by the marketplace of potential employers. The many hours, which the student has spent in tutorials, lectures, and computer labs become the means to a very specific, end here: the degree, which functions as a baseline signifier for &lsquo;employability&rsquo; in the contemporary job market. When a degree, papers and grades are displayed together in the format of the CV they are usually accompanied (and contextualised) by a listing of &lsquo;transferable skills&rsquo;, which, once acquired (at university, or elsewhere) are, in theory, applicable to any relevant professional opportunities that the student may be applying for.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="""" class=""ibimage"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/cv.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	<strong>The Crisis of the Humanities</strong></p>
<p>
	The imperatives of the promotional/neoliberal university has implications for all faculties, but in different ways, as each school and department are forced to position themselves in accordance with a service logic. Indeed, some faculties are better suited to this logic than others; however, amongst the most threatened are the humanities. At the heart of this dilemma, lies a familiar paradoxical question: How can the humanities gain authorisation from external interests (government, industry, public), by answering the calls for productive workforces; all the while maintaining the core function of developing critical or analytical perspectives of society? In all likelihood, the inherent contradiction in this question will continuously bring those interested to a moot point. Nevertheless, the schools that make up the humanities are each assigned the task of negotiating this crisis by re-branding their discipline within the terms of a service logic, while desperately holding on to the foundations and histories of their particular field.</p>
<p>
	On behalf of its Media Studies department, Vicotria University&rsquo;s Career Development and Employment service released a <em>Career View</em> article (Dec 2005) outlining the media industry, the function of the department, the &lsquo;skills&rsquo; that students develop, and crucially, the career opportunities that are available where such skills are prerequisites. In this context, the article works to respond and position the department within the discourse of the &lsquo;university as service&rsquo;. However, in transferring the Media Studies department into a branding logic, the nature of the field; its methods, approaches, theoretical frameworks andresearch are, in the <em>Career View </em>document, essentialised down to a core set of banal skills: &ldquo;written communication skills, oral communication skills, relationship skills, leadership skills, research skills, analytical skills...&rdquo; Here, the rhetorical work of &lsquo;skills&rsquo; reveals how the <em>Career View</em> document is trying to appeal to various constituencies (future students, government, industry), allowing the department to make a broadly progressive sales pitch, while also eliding the tensions inherent in its &lsquo;service&rsquo;. By way of example, Media Studies&rsquo; <em>Career View</em> document explains how students in the program will gain valuable leadership skills: &ldquo;because they understand communication&rdquo; (4).The vague use of the buzz-word &ldquo;communication&rdquo; is supposed to explain why Media Studies students should make good leaders. The connection here is actually quite tenuous though, suggesting that students will acquire these skills through some kind of osmosis as a result of the group work, presentations and so on that are a regular part of the department&rsquo;s core curricula. The flexibility of the &lsquo;skills&rsquo; rhetoric, in that it comfortably mediates the humanities with the imperatives of the neoliberal university, makes up one part of the rationale for skill-basedthinking. Elsewhere however, &ldquo;skills&rdquo; are also evaluated against &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; to indicate a kind a prolonged value to the branded self. In a guideline to preparing a CV, the &lsquo;Victoria University Career Development and Employment&rsquo; service define skills as &ldquo;practisedability; expertise&rdquo;, and argue:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:36.0pt;"">
	The great thing about &#39;skills&#39; when compared to &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; is that skills do not date. It doesn&#39;t matter where your skills are acquired - at home, work, committee meetings, or as a member of a sports team, because once developed you can use them in any environment, industry, profession or occupation. (page ref)</p>
<p>
	Indeed, &ldquo;skills&rdquo; are &ldquo;transferable&rdquo; between multiple environments, and importantly, between departments, degrees, and jobs. Therefore, the rhetorical work of skills is also to standardise the degree itself, as <em>all</em> departments are essentialised down to these skill-sets, which often overlap with each other. The emphasis on superficial and easily digestible information is precisely what branding is all about. This process recalls Barthes&rsquo; bourgeois myth-makers, who draw on common cultural knowledge and recognisable stereotypes to produce and re-produce stories, images and discourses which are used by individuals, corporations and communities to define themselves, and their relationships to the world around them (Hearn 2011). But myths also mystify, and what the logic of the CV rendersinvisible are the heavily differentiated processes of knowledge, which individual departments have to offer students. Instead, the university experience of learning is reduced to a banal list of &lsquo;transferable skills&rsquo;, individual &lsquo;experiences&rsquo;, &lsquo;achievements&rsquo;, and an overly determined set of grade scores. When viewed in the context of the trend to vocationalise New Zealand&rsquo;s tertiary education system, these discourses also have an ideological resonance that by its very nature undermines the traditional role of the humanities. Universities like Victoria are now under increasing external pressure to align internal operations with external outputs, meaning that the practice by which a department can conflate certain aspects unique to its field with the marketing &lsquo;skill-set&rsquo; in a superficial document like <em>Career View</em> may no longer be enough to guarantee their prolonged existence under the neoliberal paradigm.</p>

The evictions of  Occupy sites nationwide, especially at Zuccotti Park, have created a new hybrid by categorizing political protest as a health and safety issue, but then responding to it with the weapons of counterinsurgency. For the past few days, Occupy locations have reverberated to the sound of the force of law. I mean this literally. I was awakened at 3.30am on November 15 by the sound of what I think were helicopters above lower Manhattan. The combination of police barricades and the closure of the subways meant that no one could get closer to the eviction of Zuccotti Park. Even the airspace was closed, not to prevent the Occupy air force from deploying but to keep out the news channel helicopters. Once again, we are reminded to ""move on, there's nothing to see here.""

The park itself was suddenly flooded with klieg lighting, blinding those trying to sleep. From the Twitter feed, email and later news accounts, it's also emerged that Long Range Acoustic Devices (LRAD) were used to disperse the crowd with painful sound blasts. The LRAD was developed as a weapon of counterinsurgency after the attack on the USS Cole in 2000 by al-Qai'da and is now mounted on certain NYPD vehicles. After a set of legal maneuvers, the park was opened to the public, with the stipulation that no one can sleep there. The result was that ""anyone found lying down and even a few of those who tried to sleep sitting up were woken by security guards for Brookfield Properties."" The private corporation now has its own security force on the streets of New York, rendering Zuccotti into the latest outpost of Baghdad-Kabul Inc., the 60 billion-a-year cash-fest for private security firms.

In short, we have a full range of counterinsurgency tactics being deployed from noise and light violence to sleep deprivation and the now infamous destruction of books.

Reverting to its standard deference to counterinsurgency, the New York Times described how:

    The mayor and his advisers had grown fed up with their inability to police the park, with complaints about noise, disruptions to businesses and odors, and with a leaderless movement that they just could not figure out how to deal with.

Never mind that recent articles had shown there were more complaints about the noise from Ground Zero building work than from Zuccotti. Or that most of the failings here are on the city side: an inability to police must not be tolerated.

A few miles northwest of Zuccotti is the Cardozo Law School where Jacques Derrida delivered his epic essay ""The Force of Law"" in 1989. Reading an early essay by Walter Benjamin Critique of Violence (1921), Derrida pointed out that it is only in English that one can speak of ""enforcing"" the law. Both writers showed that law is, in the last analysis, only force but that it does everything it can to sustain what Montaigne long ago called ""the mystical foundation of authority."" It is that claim to authority, the ability to determine the relation between the sayable and the visible, which I have called visuality.

    NY Times photo showing klieg lights in action

If this deconstruction is what one might expect from Derrida, his conclusion pushed beyond the scholastic definitions of ""politics"" and ""theory"" to show why Occupy is perceived as a threat to the state that requires counterinsurgency tactics. Developing Benjamin's assertion that a general strike is ""the right to use force""--which is not at all the same as violence--on the part of labor in the same way that the state claims the right to enforce law, Derrida asserted:

    There is something of the general strike, and thus of the revolutionary situation in every reading that founds something new and that remains unreadable in regard to established canons and norms of reading that is to say the present state of reading of what figures the State, with a capital S, in the state of possible reading.

For Bloomberg, the New York Times and the other mediatic apparatus of the one percent, Occupy is and remains unreadable so it must be eliminated as pollution.

Asserting at his press conference that the decision to evict was ""mine alone,"" Bloomberg sought to restore the authority of the State for his one percent class. His comment made it clear first that he wished to be regarded as the heroic leader, justifying his claim to authority; and that he had simply decided in the manner of King George and consulted no lawyers or other functionaries, let alone the lonely occupant of the White House, who once again missed his opportunity.

Bloomberg's action was then a classic admission of failure, the failure to understand and communicate. In an indication of the absurdity of it all, the simple tent has now become the latest purported weapon of insurgency, banned from Zuccotti--but not Union Square, where a large tented holiday market is up until December 25. Tents were even banned from sale anywhere near the Occupy London site at St Paul's Cathedral. Today the City of London Corporation filed an eviction notice to Occupy London, specifically indicating that ""the Orders sought will not prevent lawful and peaceful protest in this general area and is directed at the tents and other structures."" Serious legal debate is being pursued relating to the right to bear sleeping-bags.

When the veil was banned in France, the performance duo Niqabitch parodied the ban by wearing a niqa with miniskirts.

On the N17 demonstrations, and thereafter, let's wear tents in whatever way we can.

Benjamin understood the general strike to be different from an ordinary strike “in the determination to resume only a wholly transformed work, no longer enforced by the state, an upheaval that the strike not so much causes as consummates.” In this way, most of the strikes cited by Rosa Luxemburg in her 1906 pamphlet on the general strike were local, spontaneous actions. These strikes were “general” not because everyone took part but because their aim was a general transformation and renunciation of domination. Benjamin saw this vision of revolt as not being violent but rather as “deep, moral, and genuinely revolutionary.” The right to look. The invention of the other. Or even, as Arundhati Roy put it today to OWS, ""the right to dream.""","Counterinsurgency in NYC vs the OWS general strike","Unpublished",NULL,"3815, 2593, 3857","0, 1, 2","sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/evicting_zuccotti.preview.jpg, sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/evicting_zuccotti.thumbnail.jpg, sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/evicting_zuccotti.jpg, sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/zoltan_11_15.preview.jpg, sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/zoltan_11_15.thumbnail.jpg, sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/zoltan_11_15.jpg, sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/zuccotti_11_15_i.preview.jpg, sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/zuccotti_11_15_i.thumbnail.jpg, sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/zuccotti_11_15_i.jpg"
14650,"contributed_pieces",5458,"Think Local, Act Global",1,1321473345,1321507701,2,NULL,14644,"The Tea Party’s claim to speak for the silent majority is now a distant memory, replaced by Occupy Wall Street’s slogan “We are the 99%” which lays its own claim on the voice of the people. Like the Tea Party, OWS too points out the disempowerment of the people by powerful institutions, but, the similarity evaporates almost before it registers. While one can imagine people being members of both movements or agreeing whole-heartedly on certain economic reforms, OWS and the Tea Party construct “the people” as a civic, social, or political subject in a crucially different manner.

From my position on the political outside of the Tea Party, its genealogy, allegiances, debts and allies seem comfortably clear: libertarians, nativists, white ressentiment-ists, conservative Republicans, and a sprinkling of others who found it the only tent willing to grant them refuge. Looking at Occupy Wall Street from the political inside, as someone hailed by their message, I find it harder to identify its genealogy, allegiances, debts and allies and, thus, find it harder to figure out who is addressed by the claim, “we are the 99%.” 

The obvious question (channeling Hazel Carby here [fn]Hazel V. Carby, White Women Listen! Black Feminism and the Boundaries of Sisterhood, in Black British Cultural Studies: A Reader, eds. Houston A. Baker, Manthia Diawara & Ruth H. Lindeborg, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996) pp. 61-86[/fn]) is to ask what “you” mean by saying “we” are the 99%? The claim is incredibly powerful, all the more so, for its grandly sweeping inclusiveness that equally hails the homeless person on the street and the successful plastic surgeon who brings in a high six-figure income each year. And, here is where it becomes tricky, because the 99% is clearly not a descriptive title as much as it is an invitation to identify with a particular political orientation. So, even though it technically includes the newly-minted Ivy League graduate now working for Goldman Sachs, it really doesn’t want her as she is. Similarly, the Occupy encampments have had to make their sometimes-tense, often tricky, and intensely scrutinized negotiations with those whose existing encampments have been occupied.

How do “we” respond to the call of “We are the 99%”? Who feels uneasy and who feels recognized? Who has to adapt and who feels at home? Does it spring from a sense of outrage at what was done to “us” or what has been done to “all of us” for so long? Do “we” take up the placard because “this has gone too far” or because “this has gone on for too long”?

Even with a deep appreciation for the hard work of committing to participatory, consensual democracy that is the centerpiece of Occupy, I find it difficult not to bring up questions of race, gender, class, nationality, politics in a self-reflexive moment about the positionality of the subject “we are the 99%.” It is tempting (and, largely, fair) to respond to these questions by variously pointing to the diversity of the movement(s), by claiming that now is not the time, or by saying that “we” are addressing these issues already in an ongoing dialogue. But, I would suggest that it is exactly these still-uncomfortable questions that must be the starting point for coalition and not the alliances sought out or bridges built after a political subject has begun to coalesce. It would be nice if the “we” did not start off as a renegade splinter group from the hegemonic. 

In the long interregnum between social movements in the USA, the whole point of political and cultural theory was our obsession with “difference,” specifically with the temporality of difference—the deferral of race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, nationality etc. etc. in the anti-war movement, the civil rights movement, the women’s liberation movement, the anti-colonial movements, the gay rights movement etc. etc. The “fierce urgency of now” never quite applied to all of us. In our discussions of post-modernism, post-structuralism, post-Marxism, post-colonialism, we talked about intersectionality, about the impossibility of parsing out difference except in carefully circumscribed analytic ways, about the pernicious narratives of entry into world history, about embracing agonistic multiplicity rather than consensual unity, about the reversibility of power and the necessary recognition of privilege, about learning to listen as well as speak, and about different ways of speaking and being. 

And then, suddenly, in the euphoria of the Arab Spring and the hope of the American Fall, “we” became hopeful that change might actually happen, that the people whose voices can actually be heard might start saying things “we” could agree with. And, with a tinge of anxiety that this phenomenon, this moment might be more a soufflé than a sturdy loaf of sourdough, we are reluctant to open the oven door even to take a peek at what might be baking inside. But, then, what did we learn from those decades of theory if not that theory and practice are inseparable, that what seems natural and organic is cultural, that there is no anteriority to practice, that affect is not apolitical, that coalition cannot be built on deferral, that politics cannot be read off the body? Yes, there are all kinds of people participating, but, equally, yes, there are separate interest groups and websites emerging for people of color. How do we understand this? Yes, it is incredibly exciting to finally once again, see a popular critical awareness of the social cost of corporate capitalism after so many years of fighting the culture wars. But, as others have asked, how do we move forward without losing the insight gained from the struggle on the terrain of culture?

In the call to Occupy Wall Street, the intensely-local signifier (a few blocks in lower Manhattan) points to a vast and vastly complex global financial-industrial-political system. How is the globality of Wall Street understood and refracted (mirrored?) by Occupy Wall Street? The anti/alter-globalization movement exhorted us to “think global, act local” while corporations had, in an instance of practical theoretics par excellence, been practicing “think local, act global” by localizing global brands and gaining our consent to their global regime.

The success of the Occupy/We are the 99% movement has been its decentralized incarnation across the country. But, I want to ask, is “We are the 99%” an empty signifier à la Laclau & Mouffe [fn]Ernesto Laclau & Chantal Mouffe, Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics (London: Verso, 2001)[/fn], or is it a global brand à la Jay-Z selling Occupy T-shirts? Can the radical indeterminacy of the signifier be sustained in the face of local demands? Can it keep from collapsing into a global brand that carefully manages local instantiations? If “the 99%” differ globally, or even nationally, what then might bring them together in a universal demand? A structural demand for equitable distribution of resources? A demand against hoarding? A demand for transparent governance? A mode of living and being in common? Or, maybe, is it localism (of an ecological variety) that can sustain the global? In forging a complex unity, ironically Occupy/We are the 99% might work better as a global brand than as an empty signifier since the former neatly sidesteps the problem of incompatible local desires. On the other hand, Occupy/We are the 99% as a brand runs the danger of ignoring the fundamental lesson that the role of privilege is to join and support, not build and lead. 

Alternately, to think of Occupy/We are the 99% as an empty signifier forces us to continually ask who “we” are and to interrogate the adequacy of Occupy/We are the 99% as a signifier. As the accounts from Occupy Oakland, Occupy Atlanta and (un)Occupy Albuquerque demonstrate, all politics is local. Are the 99% in Oakland the same as the 99% in New York? Or, even, are the 99% in West Harlem the same as the 99% in lower Manhattan? Going global, would the 99% in France want the same thing as the 99% in Malaysia? 

Despite the many maps showing (un)Occupy movements across the United States and the world, is the whole world really watching? Or are people engaged in their own long-standing struggles for economic justice, political freedoms and social equality? To give a random, but hopefully illustrative example, did the 2006 election of Evo Morales in Bolivia (a modest victory in the grand scale of things) even register with most Americans? Was it not a political moment to celebrate and cherish? The public acknowledgment of inspiration and indebtedness to Egyptians and Spaniards is heartening, but I still feel uneasy reading the casual use of terms like “the revolution continues worldwide” [my emphasis] on the banner of www.occupywallstreet.org.  It begs the question of the kind of global imagination we see in the Occupy movement. 
 
bell hooks’ careful unpacking of the slogan, “the personal is political,” points out that “if the personal and the political are one and the same, then there is no politicization, no way to become the radical feminist subject.” [fn]bell hooks, Feminist Politicization: A Comment, in Talking Back: Thinking Feminist, Thinking Black (Boston: South End Press, 1989), p. 106[/fn] I agree completely with those who argue that the power and beauty of Occupy Wall Street lies in the becoming of political subjects, in flexing our political agency, in occupying public space and rediscovering the body politic, in refusing the separation of spheres of human activity, and in living and feeling community—basically, in insisting the personal is political. In the face of this, the rigidity of formalized demands comprehensible in the existing political frameworks is, indeed, an unnecessary foreclosure of what might be baking in the oven. 

However, as hooks points out, to recognize the possibility of performing differently, of noting a different trajectory for political subjects, of valuing the myriad ways of being embodied subjects, of remembering that the political is deeply personal does not disrupt this process, it simply keeps the space open for this process to expand indefinitely. For example, in the midst of this moment, can “we” keep in mind what the Comrades from Cairo said as they gently reminded Occupy that they have joined “years-long struggles by people and popular movements” and reassured them that “we are all watching one another now, and from Cairo we want to say that we are in solidarity with you, and we love you all for what you are doing.” Ask yourself, how the “we” in that statement fits in with the “we” in “we are the 99%”?

In the foregrounding of demands to eradicate unfair student debt, is there room to also fully acknowledge the debt owed (most recently) to students, workers, and citizens in North Africa and southern Europe? Why not call the movement American indignados? Is it possible to avoid asking to what extent the 99% in the United States are part of the global 1%? This is not simply a rhetorical question to highlight obvious disparities. Rather, it is my hope, my utopian impossible demand, my vision of social justice that the American revolution not take place first in America.

	On October 15, Michael Kimmelman, the architecture critic of&nbsp;<em>The New York Times</em>, published an article with a discursive take on physical structures.&nbsp; Readers were confronted with a discussion of the politics of space.&nbsp; (Kimmelman calls it&nbsp;<em>place,</em>&nbsp;though I would contest that the difference between place and space is that the former is purely physical and the latter involves enacted&nbsp;discourse.)</p>
<p>
	The piece is titled&nbsp;<em>In Protest, the Power of Place</em>&nbsp;and can be found&nbsp;<a class=""ext"" data-mce-href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/sunday-review/wall-street-protest-shows-power-of-place.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/sunday-review/wall-street-protest-shows-power-of-place.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kent State, Tiananmen Square, the Berlin Wall: we clearly use locales, edifices, architecture to house our memories and political energy. Politics troubles our consciences. But places haunt our imaginations,&rdquo; writes&nbsp;Kimmelman.</p>
<p>
	During an address from Judith Butler on October 23rd&nbsp;at Washington Square Park, the philosopher echoed a similar sentiment.&nbsp; &ldquo;It matters that as bodies we arrive together in public, that we are assembling in public; we are coming together as bodies in alliance in the street and in the square,&rdquo; she&nbsp;stated.</p>
<p>
	Since September 17th, Liberty Square has transformed from an almost invisible place to an occupied space.&nbsp; By this, I imply that physical bodies &ndash; and the discourse between these physical bodies &ndash; are the nucleus of a now global movement.&nbsp; The world&rsquo;s reactions, whether it is the multiplicity of occupations budding from ripe ground or the shifting political consciousness &ndash; the zeitgeist &ndash; all hedge on the ideas that bodies, individually and<em>en masse</em>&nbsp;are&nbsp;powerful.</p>
<p>
	It should be fairly clear that physicality matters, for a number of reasons, in building a movement.&nbsp; As Kimmelmen points out, &ldquo;places haunt our imaginations.&rdquo;&nbsp; Spaces also give the global gaze an identifiable, physical referent.&nbsp; Spaces are&nbsp;symbolic.</p>
<p>
	In New York City, a city especially known for crowded spaces often mediated by structures like mobile technology or the fear of strangers, Liberty Square seems to do the impossible.&nbsp; In one small space, the discourse of bodies&nbsp;<em>en masse&nbsp;</em>has shifted from averted eyes and &ldquo;missed connections&rdquo; to a willful and immediate need to communicate.&nbsp; Bodies sit, sleep, eat, march and engage in direct Democratic discourse while physically touching and making eye contact.&nbsp; This sort of space is a petri dish of political thought, activism, art and, most importantly, empowerment.&nbsp; Through the multiplicity of bodies, individuals can realize and internalize a human tool often silenced in everyday life: the&nbsp;voice.</p>
<p>
	Use of voice allows the movement to communicate with itself, to grow from a fledgling grassroots call-to-arms to a more paramount internalization of what it means to &ldquo;occupy.&rdquo;&nbsp; As strangers come together as bodies, to live and engage in discourse, the movement grows bigger than any park or public space.&nbsp; While the reclamation of public space is, without a doubt, imperative, it is only the start.&nbsp; The movement&rsquo;s shifting gaze, internally, and the world&rsquo;s gaze upon it, give rise to the possibility of something&nbsp;revolutionary.</p>
<p>
	While occupy began as a physical movement, it has grown into less tangible realms.&nbsp; Occupy has grown into what I have called an infinitely open signifier.&nbsp; It is individualized, though self aware. &nbsp;It loosely refers to a type of paradigm shift.&nbsp; The term &ldquo;occupy,&rdquo; once rooted in the very physicality that helped it rise as a cultural zeitgeist, is no longer chained to bodies&nbsp;<em>en masse</em>. &nbsp;It has grown to occupy&nbsp;<a class=""ext"" data-mce-href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/24/occupy-wall-street-education-rand-paul_n_1029409.html"" href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/24/occupy-wall-street-education-rand-paul_n_1029409.html"" target=""_blank"">education</a>, occupy the&nbsp;<a class=""ext"" data-mce-href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/business/media/why-not-occupy-newsrooms.html?hp"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/business/media/why-not-occupy-newsrooms.html?hp"" target=""_blank"">newsroom</a>, and occupy the&nbsp;<a class=""ext"" data-mce-href=""http://occupiedmedia.com/2011/10/the-peoples-library/"" href=""http://occupiedmedia.com/2011/10/the-peoples-library/"" target=""_blank"">mind</a>.</p>
<p>
	While less tangible, these new realms are just as powerful &ndash; perhaps more.&nbsp; Occupy has successfully inserted itself into the public discourse &ndash; and for all the critics out there &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to go anywhere, anytime soon.&nbsp; Raid a space, more tents spring up.&nbsp; Evict bodies from a space permanently, the zeitgeist remains.&nbsp; While the physicality of Liberty Square is what inspired the movement&rsquo;s beginning, occupy is now so large and so multi-faceted that no amount of street cleaning or police threat will demolish it. &nbsp;Frankly, there&rsquo;s nowhere left to go but&nbsp;forward.</p>

<p>
	October 28th. After weeks of impossibly upbeat posts (impossible because no movement can have an ever-upward arc), I finally sounded a worried note.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	My blog for that day:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	<em>This afternoon, there was intense rain. Although the tents stayed up, most people decamped to a nearby church, as well as the public atrium at 60 Wall Street. Someone said, &ldquo;There may be snow tomorrow&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m wondering how long protesters can hold the park, with their minimal tents, as temperatures drop further. Before the winter sets in and manages to clear Zuccotti (Liberty Plaza), exactly as the city hopes will happen, it&rsquo;s very important that people figure out where affinity groups, infrastructure, and networks will go next. The movement needs to evolve beyond holding on to this one block of city land.<a href=""#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1"" title=""""><strong>[i]</strong></a></em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	October 29th. The previous night&rsquo;s meeting at <em>16 Beaver</em> was about &ldquo;Artists. Role in the Occupy Movement.&rdquo; The presentations went on too long, the discussion section was shorted and frustration about lack of holistic thinking was in the air. Online, the Arts &amp; Culture committee was vibrant, but face to face, some members keep expressing worry about what will come next. In the middle of the meeting, Beka Economopoulos of <em>Not An Alternative</em> gets an SMS about a security issue at the park. Later, she says to me, &ldquo;Holding on to, and maintaining, Zuccotti Park, is taking up all the energy of the organizers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	That day, my blog had a change in tone. Now I finally mentioned what I had left out of the previous day&rsquo;s post. Beka had reminded me that there were many worries beside cold weather.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	<em>The success of the movement has attracted hustlers and provocateurs. When rain had driven people to the church and there were only a few &ldquo;peacekeepers&rdquo; at the site, two very aggressive men used that opportunity to try to start a fight over each other&rsquo;s signs (&ldquo;you got to take that sign down&rdquo;). The police watched and did nothing. I had the feeling they did not mind. The colder it gets, the fewer people at the site, the more these negative elements will have space to flex muscle. The media is also waiting for that moment, of course.</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	<em>Do we have to make a fetish out of this space? The dedicated organizers already have their meetings at 60 Wall Street and elsewhere. Work is getting done in small groups. The &ldquo;Spoke&rdquo; model passing in General Assembly is an acknowledgment of that fact. Why not spread the movement to other decentralized locations? In fact, why not use some of the money donated to the OWS movement to rent a large space for a year, and use that as an organizational hub. </em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	A few days later, Caroline Busta from the Wall Street Occupennial artist group highlights an article by Matt Harvey about destructive elements within the movement. Among other saboteur elements, the article highlights Gary Phenof:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	<em>With his bear-like size and self-professed &ldquo;combative style,&rdquo; Gary Phenof, a 50-something Staten Islander would be hard to miss in any crowd. Wearing a Russian hat, waving a full-size main-land China flag and giving out copies of the China Daily&mdash;even at the far edge of Zuccotti Park&mdash;Phenof stuck out like a sore thumb.<a href=""#_edn2"" name=""_ednref2"" title=""""><strong>[ii]</strong></a></em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	I look at the photograph of Phenof and realize this is the same man who started the argument on the day of the heavy rains. Interestingly, he started it just when most people were taking refuge from the rain in the church, so there were very few peacekeepers around. It seemed designed to cause maximum harm and bad press. Agent provocateur.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	I hesitate to highlight this news because I worry they will take the wind out of the movement. What should we do? But how can we stay silent as race/gender safe spaces erode&hellip;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Chris Kasper pointed out:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	<em>I think not talking about this presents us with more of a threat to take the wind out of the movement than getting it out and talking about it. I think the erosion of safe places makes it more urgent to talk about. We&rsquo;ve survived infiltration by James O&rsquo;keefe, right wing attack ads, &rdquo;oath keepers&rdquo; and other libertarian groups, a bs Brookfield eviction, police violence and are having some success mediating with the drummers. We need to find a way to work through this if we want the movement to go further.</em></p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	November 14<sup>th</sup>. Adbusters presciently publishes a new tactical briefing. Although credited for giving the first call for September 17<sup>th </sup>(along with Anonymous, who seem to have lost interest as OWS became mainstream), Adbusters had been quieter in the discussions around the movement. But this new briefing called for regrouping as winter approached:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	<em>We declare &quot;victory&quot; and throw a party &hellip; a festival &hellip; a potlatch &hellip; a jubilee &hellip; a grand gesture to celebrate, commemorate, rejoice in how far we&#39;ve come, the comrades we&#39;ve made, the glorious days ahead. Imagine, on a Saturday yet to be announced, perhaps our movement&#39;s three month anniversary on December 17, in every #OCCUPY in the world, we reclaim the streets for a weekend of triumphant hilarity and joyous revelry. We dance like we&#39;ve never danced before and invite the world to join us. Then we clean up, scale back and most of us go indoors while the die-hards hold the camps. We use the winter to brainstorm, network, build momentum so that we may emerge rejuvenated with fresh tactics, philosophies, and myriad projects ready to rumble next Spring.</em><a href=""#_edn3"" name=""_ednref3"" title="""">[iii]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	I say prescient because, the night after this briefing comes out, New York City launches the notorious 1 am surprise raid that clears out Zuccotti and destroys two months worth of infrastructure (claims that all of it can be recovered from compounds are later proven false, as with the largely missing 5000 book People&rsquo;s Library).</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	By the way, I am always reminded by others to call it &ldquo;Liberty Plaza&rdquo;, but the November 15<sup>th</sup> action reminds us that the state will continue to try to enforce &ldquo;Zuccotti&rdquo;, by force. Should we continue to trying this rebranding, this &ldquo;liberation&rdquo;, or find other, more hospitable, Liberty Plazas?</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The day after the raid, Noah Fischer, one of the organizers of Occupy Museums, sounds exhausted on his Facebook wall, highlighting how the city&rsquo;s repressive tactics are burning up our precious energies:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	<em>So for the rest of the middle of the night and early morning, we few hundred people leaving the park or rushing to the scene got caught up in a demoralizing series of police traps in lower Manhattan&hellip; </em></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	<em>In the morning, there was an attempt to &ldquo;take&rdquo; another park on Canal Street. That failed, since the space was ominously enclosed like a big trap, and most people left before the police forcibly removed the hard-core protesters.</em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Yes, the struggle is also the movement. As resistance has mounted, the movement has grown. In a display of battering ram polemics, Keith Olbermann calls Mayor Bloomberg a valuable asset to the Occupy movement:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	<em>American freedom has not flourished in spite of these morons of history, it has flourished because of them &mdash; because they overreacted, because they under-thought, overreached, under-understood&hellip; Who else but a clich&eacute; like Bloomberg could take a protest beginning to grow a little stale around the edges and vault it back in the headlines, complete with mortifying scenes of police dressed as storm troopers, carrying military weapons, using figurative bazookas to kill figurative mosquitoes? &hellip; </em></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	<em>Who else but the epitome of tone-deafness that is Bloomberg could have better illustrated the fundamental issue of Occupy, when he puts the entire weight of the most people-driven city in the history of the Earth behind already-crushingly rich and their efforts to grab themselves still more advantages from those people and he, himself, is the 12th richest man in America? Who else but a publicity addict like Bloomberg could have enabled the arrest of 700 protesters on the Brooklyn Bridge and yet, two months later, frozen 20 square miles of New York City in gridlock traffic over two days, so somebody could film another goddamned Batman movie on the 59th Street Bridge?<a href=""#_edn4"" name=""_ednref4"" title=""""><strong>[iv]</strong></a></em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	So indeed, it is true, through his &ldquo;get a job&rdquo; moralizing, bullying tactics and this raid, coordinated with other city mayors across America (inadvertently blurted out by Mayor Quan), Bloomberg has repeatedly galvanized the movement. The evening after the raids, an hour after the park was finally reopened, the crowds at the General Assembly had gone up tenfold. I couldn&rsquo;t remember a recent GA that had been this large in the last few weeks. The air was electric again. But this energy can also be misleading, we should not be seduced into thinking temporarily being &ldquo;allowed back&rdquo; into the park, is what is best for the movement.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Even some of the more junior police officers look exhausted and tired of this endless policing of peaceful protests. A group of officers in CPR (Community Police Relations) jackets try to make some GA attendees get off a park ledge where they are sitting, citing concerns about &ldquo;safety.&rdquo; Within moments, the meeting is interrupted and &ldquo;let them sit / let them sit&rdquo; chants fill the air. I don&#39;t find this a jubilant or important moment. The officers are very junior (interestingly, all African-American), and probably too scared to go back to their commanding officer and say &ldquo;Sir, they want to continue sitting.&rdquo; Is this confrontation the best use of our energy?</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	After the GA ends, Haig Aivazian who had been at many earlier GAs said to me:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:22.5pt;"">
	<em>There is no sense in being prisoners to our own symbolism, and there is no need to exhaust ourselves for sheer hard headedness. All for a park that is increasingly limited, policed, trivialized and symbolic. There is a victory in today&rsquo;s mass showing, but it is also a perfect time to rethink the strategy. Let us fragment the struggle, make it networked and decentralized&ndash; like the forms of capital we are opposing. And reclaim Liberty Square whenever we please for GA.</em></p>
<p>
	<br />
	The next day, November 16<sup>th</sup>, there is rain all afternoon. On ustream (which had stayed live when livestream was knocked off air after the raid) the &ldquo;other99&rdquo;cameraman was broadcasting again from Zuccotti and saying, &ldquo;People, please come down here. Our numbers are small today. The CNN truck is here. We need to show them we have numbers in the park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Behind him the camera picks up scattered groups of wet protesters, and just as many police officers and park officials. Apparently Fox News was jubilantly declaring &ldquo;Occupy is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Why do we need to show CNN or Fox anything? We are meant to be building alternative systems for our future, not participating in the mainstream media&rsquo;s 15 minutes of flickering interest circus.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We do not have endless energy to spare, to wage daily cat and mouse sorties with the police (&ldquo;Miss, no standing at the intersection&rdquo; the moment someone even slows down their pace). At the end of the day, the police are still drawing overtime, so they can rationalize it by saying, &ldquo;this is my job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	What do we get from this endless rubbing up against police barricades? Personally I am really tired of going on marches while being penned in by those interlocked metal barricades.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We need to save some energy, to organize, create and build&hellip; elsewhere.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Astra Taylor, co-editor of a forthcoming Verso Books anthology of OWS essays, says:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:22.5pt;"">
	<em>A semi-permanent encampment is not the only way to occupy. And tweaking our methods may actually help make the movement more inclusive, as not everyone who is sympathetic to OWS can or wants to commit to living full-time in a tent. The Occupy movement, after all, was never about holding a single piece of ground, but changing the world.<a href=""#_edn5"" name=""_ednref5"" title=""""><strong>[v]</strong></a></em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Two other organizers, Zolt&aacute;n Gl&uuml;ck and Manissa McCleave Maharawal, write of the need to focus back on our important tasks:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:22.5pt;"">
	<em>This spectacle of repression should not distract us from the important tasks we have at hand, nor should it overshadow the great strides we&rsquo;ve made in the past months. There is no evicting a movement&hellip; </em></p>
<p style=""margin-left:22.5pt;"">
	<em>We are just beginning. Working groups from OWS have meetings and events planned for months ahead. They will continue to meet and they will continue to grow.<a href=""#_edn6"" name=""_ednref6"" title=""""><strong>[vi]</strong></a></em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	I just looked at the New York General Assembly&rsquo;s Calendar of Events. Starting off with the first week, when this looked like a simple Google Calendar, it has ballooned out to an endless list of events. For today, there are multiple events every hour on the hour. Looking down, I see the page button goes up to 1,452.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Page 1,452 shows that the event calendar has items (set on &ldquo;repeat daily&rdquo; or &ldquo;weekly&rdquo;) all the way up to December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2012. Planning events for a year from now seems slightly fanciful. Then again, it also seems optimistic.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	A colleague who is a lawyer defending homeowners against foreclosures reminds me that we need to be reflective, celebratory, practical, forward-looking, and inspiring -- all at once. So let us start on a macro and micro, holistic and granular level. Find a project, an affinity group, an alternative art space, a progressive organizing space, a classroom, an immigrant rights group, a trade union; anything, everything, somewhere in your neighborhood, in your city. Start building something specific, tangible&ndash; linked to the larger Occupy project of economic justice and resisting corporate control over democracy. &nbsp;All in preparation for spring, when people will start coming out in large numbers again. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to go against some of the fetish of horizontalism; the movement needs some leaders as well. Time to move to the second phase.</p>

<div class=""content"">
	<p>
		<a class=""ext"" href=""http://youtu.be/BjnR7xET7Uo"" target=""_blank"">Look at the video</a>. The students sit calmly, surrounded by chanting supporters. The masked perpetrator walks calmly to them and like a house painter would a wall, blasts them with pepper spray. The near serenity in his gait, in his gesture, speaks to an ease with which power asserts itself through violence. The very relaxed air is almost more chilling than the thought of the pepper spray burning the&nbsp;eyes.</p>
	<p>
		After the rage inspired by the criminal use of force in this video, the next thing that is clear is one, the speed and carelessness with which the forces of power are willing to use violence against non violent protest when the protest represents a real and present threat to existing conditions. The initial pepper spray is so clearly an abuse of the weapon that if there is not an investigation leading to criminal charges it only indicates yet again that not only is the police state made manifest, so is the absurdity of calling the justice system just.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		While the eventual retreat of the offending group of aggressors is a victory for the students and demonstrators, what is demonstrated here is the always present violence the so-called forces of law have within arm&rsquo;s reach at all times. That proximity to violence, and the arbitrariness with which they use it, is how power addresses any option for real dialogue, whether they actually use weapons or merely hold them in&nbsp;threat.</p>
	<p>
		The retreat at the end is striking for a number of reasons. The first is clear:&nbsp;a victory of the people&rsquo;s mic, non-violence and the willingness of the students to hold their ground in the face of an armed force that has just shown its willingness to use its weapons without regard to the conditions on the ground. That the protestors were sitting, non-violently, recalls immediately the image that first galvanized rage around Occupy Wall Street of the women in orange netting being coldly sprayed by the officer&nbsp; Anthony Bologna, who bragged, &ldquo;<a class=""ext"" href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2051870/Occupy-Wall-Street-pepper-spray-cop-Anthony-Bologna-Id-again.html"" target=""_blank"">I&rsquo;d do it again</a>.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>
		Another striking feature is the genuine fear in the masked faces as they retreat. Perhaps because of the many cameras, or just their own shock at their comrade&rsquo;s attack, they too realized the cruelty of the moment. Their recoil is loaded with genuine fear -it&rsquo;s clear- that this unruly crowd has been galvanized and might just be willing to not take any more. Their arms and pepper spray are outnumbered and if the students disregard their non-violence it would be the masked police who would risk serious harm. But their fear, or the realization that they had pushed things too far, also opens the door to a humanizing&nbsp;moment.</p>
	<p>
		This moment, their first step back, represents a transformational opportunity. It is times like this when history holds it breath and opens to a change. The same pregnant pause occurred in Tahrir, just before the army joined the demonstrators and when the tanks would not crush the lone figure in Tiananmen. Poised on the precipice of the abyss, each of those officers has a decision to make, to break ranks and stand with justice and against arbitrary cruelty. But the force of history, the present, social conditions is obviously great. While any one of them might have thought, &ldquo;This is wrong. I&nbsp;should be protecting them,&rdquo;&nbsp;the challenge to speak is based more than just the present moment. Indeed, a salary, economic realities , children are all tied up in that decision because a betrayal of his ranks represents not only a risk to financial stability but also to a whole way of thinking and&nbsp;being.</p>
	<p>
		We can only hope that these moments are not brushed aside and that people as brave and strong as t he <span class=""caps"">UC</span>&nbsp;Davis students stand up more so that not only do they drive back the small cadre of aggressors but also drive back the inner police state that is borne in each of those individuals, and all too often in all of&nbsp;us.</p>

	Abstract: This post reflects on the spatial organization of the Occupy Philadelphia camp outside City Hall, and in particular investigates-self conscious efforts to create an image of activism through the reuse, and display of signage.&nbsp; It suggests that even though the various Occupy movements rely heavily on virtual and social media materiality, and the raw, serve as crucial aesthetic mechanisms to generate a sense of authenticity and urgency.</p>

<p>
	Walking down Market Street my partner and I turned towards City Hall&mdash;I wanted to go through the walkway inside the building plaza to see if a mural project I had visited some months ago was still there, since it was covering construction.&nbsp; We found all four entrances obstructed, curious for a major pedestrian thoroughfare, and went around the building, finding a large encampment spread across the north side of the edifice.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Occupy&rdquo; many signs said, some handmade, some typed, some laminated while others on raw cardboard.&nbsp; Wandering around the camp, which had at one pm on a Sunday during the feel of a music festival, with campers having food, hanging out in the sunlight, and playing with dogs during a lull between events.&nbsp; An assortment of different kinds of tents could be seen, with varying signs: a Quaker prayer tent, a Ron Paul campaign poster, a Sukkah, &ldquo;Eat more Food,&rdquo; among many others, creating a bricolage of political, religious and aesthetic affiliations.&nbsp; &nbsp;Although the Occupy is accused of being without demand, and largely coordinates actions through social media, a walk through an encampment reveals that first that &ldquo;demands&rdquo; are both explicit and in the process of constantly being framed and reframed, and second that social media is not used at the exclusion of the material&mdash;public spaces are actively shaped to re-imagine political potential through the reclamation of public space.&nbsp; The cardboard sign provides a crucial fulcrum for generating a sense of publicity and message.</p>

	Part of the reason for violent reactions against Occupy participants is an underlying fear of genuinely public space on the part of city managers, elites, and police.&nbsp; For space to be truly public it needs to be up for grabs, open to many different forms of life, of communication, and can get messy.&nbsp; A characteristic element of urban space in major U.S. cities is that &ldquo;developed&rdquo; urban centers are glossy and smooth: they invite flows of commerce, of people, of transportation, but not accumulation, a sense of safety and attraction without intimacy-- space that contours but does not hold.&nbsp; This is one reason why there have been so many wars against homelessness, since they are a population that pushes space to its seams, using it more than a conduit, the products of the privatization of public resources in the hollowing out of the welfare state.&nbsp; In <em>Right to the City</em> Don Mitchell charts the relationship between the eradication of public space and the war against the homeless, and in &ldquo;Aesthetics of Superfluity&rdquo; Achille Mbembe articulates the ways in which colonial cities require architectural environments that promote flow rather than dwelling in order to prevent confrontation with some of the uglier elements of colonial legacies.&nbsp; Both of these arguments illuminate my surface reading of one of the aesthetic strategies at work in the Occupy Philadelphia campsite.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Across from the information tent, and the information bulletin board, a palimpsest of different notices, and signs a combination of printouts and handwritten papers, is a horizontal wall of signs on the sidewalk, on the western periphery of the camp.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shut it down,&rdquo; &ldquo;We are the People&hellip;Really,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jah Bless the Jobless,&rdquo; &ldquo;Subprime Lenders Targeted Black and Brown People,&rdquo; &ldquo;Racism in the Movement Divides Ou Power,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey pampered CEOs, Shine Your Own Shoes!&rdquo; &ldquo;Education Gap &szlig;&gt; Income Gap,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stop the Humanitarian Bombing in Libya!&rdquo; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t believe that corporations are people until Texas executes one,&rdquo; &ldquo;End corporate influence this is not true democracy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Respect the ground, don&rsquo;t litter,&rdquo; &ldquo;Our kids futures are not for sale,&rdquo; &ldquo;People- Revolt,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fox News Lies,&rdquo; and so forth</p>
<p>
	The signs, crumpled, sometimes laid one on top of the other, often ripped from pizza and banana boxes display an kind of vulnerability and making-do.&nbsp; They are not typed out, they are not laminated and they are hand written suggesting imperfection but also unrepeatability.&nbsp; The signs are not grandiose, they are humble, and form an ephemeral archive of previous demonstrations.&nbsp; One could say that it is historical but the encampment&nbsp; gestures to a model of politics which does not operate based on spectacular events but rather through rehabilitating the everyday: whatever demonstration, tent decoration, or pole marker that the signs had served as in their vertical life times is not separated from their horizontal present.&nbsp; They mark a connection between politics as a form of life and shape for communal action.</p>
<p>
	However, the signs also form a point of entry for new publics.&nbsp;&nbsp; David Henkin argued that signs are &ldquo;captions&rdquo; for dynamic urban landscapes that communicate with other signs even if they are working for different goals and &ldquo;confirm and enhance&rdquo; each other (52, 55). &nbsp;The gathering of cardboard salutations mentioned above clearly do not offer a unified narrative that admits to a clear endpoint to Occupy&rsquo;s action.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead they illuminate on the level of the visual the democratic potential that Occupy by trying to expand circuits of communication and the range actors who can participate in a city&rsquo;s public life.&nbsp; The signs, a form of address used by politics, education, and commerce as well cuts across different publics (Henkin 174) and allows people to cultivate orientations to public space.</p>
<p>
	If anything Occupy is an ongoing performance against the superfluity that has characterized a liquefied market economy and a general orientation to non-spectacular life in the United States.&nbsp; Not immediately legible, not sleek, mistaken as debris, and trite unrest the signage placed on the edge of the encampment attests to an elongated form of politics, one based on using ordinary, even low-grade materials, in common space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The City of Philadelphia is planning to evict occupiers at the time of writing this post, November 27<sup>th</sup> at 5pm.&nbsp; Homes, people, and the fragile signs will be forcibly removed to return the City Hall plaza to a superfluous space of low, rather than place of dwelling.&nbsp; Specifically, for a $50 million construction project to begin on Dilworth plaza, another privatization of public space. It is important to note that this movement has also created a space for Philadelphia&#39;s homeless to dwell with less molestation from authorities-- this displacement merely repeats, and is not too different from the series of displacements of homeless that occur in cities across the country on a normalized basis.&nbsp; The archive of signs on the plaza are&nbsp; not aesthetically different from the signs that homeless people use to gain visibility, handwriting being both of necessity and an important way to signal embodied vulnerability. Don Mitchell&#39;s suggestion: that that the right to the city is at its basis a right to exist, is sadly undesrcored by these events.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the wake of this impending destruction, the Occupy facebook feed has showed messages urging supporters to document the displacement and potential confrontation, creating yet another archive of the ephemeral, demonstrating the importance of marking, bearing witness to, creating a set of signs to point to ongoing social dislocations in rapidly evaporating public space.</p>

As examples of the sorts of practices she is advocating, Verson offers the possibilities provided by the public praxis of visual arts in murals and the subvertising, the politicisation of the stage &ndash; in the dual sense that overtly political themes are addressed and that the stage is opened up for the &lsquo;spect-actors&rsquo; to intervene<a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote6sym"" name=""sdfootnote6anc""><sup>6</sup></a> &ndash; in forum theatre, and the application of principles learned from carnival to street-protests as &lsquo;tactical frivolity&rsquo; in the form of samba bands and groups of clowns.</font></font></p>

	<font color=""#000000""><font size=""3"">The first of these examples is perhaps the least interesting, involving as it does little more than the pressing-into-service of artistic principles and techniques for what is at best a more effective or subtle means of attracting people to a cause. This objection cannot be raised so easily either to forum theatre or to tactical frivolity, which both in different ways go beyond attempts to influence a public that is conceived as being a mere observer or consumer. Both are means of empowering the subject, the former by using the medium of theatre to explore possible courses of action that can then as it were be acted out in life away from the stage, the latter through the attempt to &lsquo;make rebellion enjoyable, effective and irresistible&rsquo;, to create forms &lsquo;of rebellion that embody the movements&rsquo; principles of diversity, creativity, decentralization, horizontality, and direct action&rsquo;.<a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote7sym"" name=""sdfootnote7anc""><sup>7</sup></a></font></font></p>

	<font color=""#000000""><font size=""3"">At the same time, they both retain a strong similarity to subvertising and murals in that their mode of operation consists in the subordinating of elements of artistic praxis to &ndash; in the broadest sense &ndash; political means. While practitioners of tactical frivolity claim that the transformation of carnival into a militant presence on the streets &lsquo;means turning what we consider to be political on its head&rsquo;,<a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote8sym"" name=""sdfootnote8anc""><sup>8</sup></a> this redefinition of what we think of as the political sphere takes place only within very restricted limits. It enables what is perhaps best seen as a change in the content of politics within the limits imposed on it by bourgeois society, without challenging these limits in which politics takes place. Even by this expanded and transformed understanding, politics remains the site of interaction between different social forces, even if these interactions are no longer so strongly mediated by the state. The attempts of forum theatre and tactical frivolity to strengthen the subject are a means of redressing power-imbalances that result from structural inequality and violence. They do not, however, as such alter the framework in which this inequality exists. As means of strengthening the subject under capitalism, they seek to effect a redistribution of subjective power. As such they are bound to the reinforcement of capitalist subjectivity &ndash; by which I mean not the subjectivity of the capitalist as defined in opposition to the proletarian or peasant, but rather subjectivity as it exists under capitalism &ndash; rather than its abolition.</font></font></p>

	<font color=""#000000""><font size=""3"">In subordinating art to the service of the political, however widely understood, such attempts lose sight of what it is that constitutes art&rsquo;s specific political potential. This potential consists not in the capacity of art to reach an audience that might otherwise not be exposed to particular political arguments, nor in its ability strongly to move and thereby to arouse profound emotions about political issues. It consists rather in the aestheticist ideal of art for its own sake. By proclaiming that it exists purely for its own sake, art rejects the logic of commodity society according goods are produced for the sake of what they can be exchanged for. The artwork that exists purely for itself rejects this logic of being-for-another and in so doing points to the possibility of a world that is not mediated by commodity-production. This is by no means celebration of an apolitical aestheticism but rather an insistence that it is inappropriate to consider even what appears to be the most aloof withdrawal from the political sphere as apolitical.</font></font></p>

It is not a claim that practical being &ndash; life as we are compelled to live it &ndash; is somehow inauthentic, but an insistence that things as they are differ radically from things as they should be. Or to put it in Adorno&rsquo;s terms, that life as we live it is profoundly damaged.

The task is to conceive of how we might be able to move from an aesthetic theory to an aesthetic praxis, and of how aesthetic theory and praxis might be related. </span></span></font></font><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Adorno insists that there exists within art the trace of a praxis that is in a radical sense yet-to-come. &lsquo;Artworks draw credit on a praxis which has not yet begun, and of which no one can say whether it will honour its exchange.&rsquo;<a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote11sym"" name=""sdfootnote11anc""><sup>11</sup></a> There is something necessarily unknowable about this praxis &ndash; it has elements which ensure that it cannot, under existing social relations, be known in its totality. Like artworks themselves, such a praxis must be understood as being not only far removed from empirical reality, but also aimed at fundamentally altering and removing the constraints in which it exists.</span></p>
<p align=""left"" style=""text-indent: 21.17mm; margin-bottom: 0mm; font-style: normal; line-height: 150%;"">
	This praxis that is yet to come is related to the development of artworks out of cultic ritual, what Adorno terms</p>

	<span style=""font-style: normal;"">the magical origin of artworks: they were elements of a praxis, which wanted to influence nature, separated themselves from it in the beginnings of rationality, and gave up the deception of real influence.<a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote12sym"" name=""sdfootnote12anc""><sup>12</sup></a></span></p>

	Artworks, that is, carry within themselves the trace of the historical and prehistorical mystical praxis in which they have their origins. It is by renouncing this praxis &ndash; by renouncing the claim to influence through ritual the reality in which they exist &ndash; that artworks take on their peculiar character within capitalist social relations, that they come to stand outside the means-ends rationality that characterises bourgeois (if not only bourgeois) society. Artworks, that is, take on a status that resists the permeation of life by the social of commodity society precisely by renouncing their claim to have a direct influence on life, a renunciation that becomes inevitable only through the development of the very instrumental reason whose influence artworks come to resist.</p>
<p align=""left"" style=""text-indent: 21.17mm; margin-bottom: 0mm; line-height: 150%;"">
	<span style=""font-style: normal;"">And yet there are different ways in which artworks can develop from their origins in the rejection of magic praxis. Adorno&rsquo;s comments on Beckett&rsquo;s </span><i>Endgame</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> offers a stark rejoinder to what he terms &lsquo;the art which through its beginnings, its distance from any praxis, in the face of the threat of death, became ideology through the harmlessness of its mere form&rsquo;.<a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote13sym"" name=""sdfootnote13anc""><sup>13</sup></a> This is the significance of Adorno&rsquo;s claim that what artworks say &lsquo;is not what their words say&rsquo;<a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote14sym"" name=""sdfootnote14anc""><sup>14</sup></a> &ndash; any attempt to reduce an artwork to its paraphrasable content (and indeed, any artwork that makes the claim to be identical with this propositional content) will lapse into the promotion of ideology. In </span><i>Endgame</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, in contrast, &lsquo;the determinate negation of its content becomes a formal principle and the negation of content as such&rsquo;.<a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote15sym"" name=""sdfootnote15anc""><sup>15</sup></a> This is the necessary consequence of the forced retreat from praxis with which art begins: it is through the negation of artistic content by means of artistic praxis &ndash; technique &ndash; that artworks are able to remove themselves from the context of means-ends rationality.</span></p>

	This has significant consequences for the way in which we might think about the relationship between art and society &ndash; and more particularly, about the interaction between art and emancipatory politics. For this interaction cannot consists simply in the application of artistic techniques or procedures in order somehow to make a restricted version of political action more playful. Anything that can be thought of as an aesthetic praxis must aim not at a reconfiguring of relations within the framework of society as we know it, but rather at the dissolution of this framework:</p>

	The Occupy Wall Street movement states that its purpose is &nbsp;&ldquo;fighting back against the corrosive power of major banks and multinational corporations over the democratic process, and the role of Wall Street in creating an economic collapse that has caused the greatest recession in generations&rdquo; (Occupy Wall Street, 2011). The occupy movement states that they represent the 99% of society who are oppressed by the richest 1% who control the global economy (Occupy Wall Street, 2011). They are undoubtedly correct. However, their analysis may only be the prick of a surgeon&rsquo;s scalpel that now must be plunged straight through to the heart of society.</p>
<p>
	The dichotomous divisions and seemingly simple categorizations; i.e. 1%/99%, wall street/everyone else, economic oppression, tend to obscure one of the most pressing issues of contemporary social movements; their occurrence in a postmodern society. If we suspend our judgment for a moment and assume that we live in a postmodern society characterized by a lack of definable boundaries between various social classes and social structures, a lack of an objective or universal reality and the proliferation of subjective interpretations which all seem viable, then Occupy Wall Street, and the terms used to describe it, run the risk of becoming archaic and simplistic because they are rooted in modernism. At worst, they may degenerate into propaganda.</p>
<p>
	In the past, the protagonists and the antagonists of revolutions and social movements (depending on one&rsquo;s point of view) were clearly definable, i.e. the 3<sup>rd</sup>estate struggled against the nobility, proletariat struggled against the bourgeoisie etc. What becomes problematic is when the aims of contemporary movements are also seen dichotomously. The &ldquo;end&rdquo; of contemporary social movements lies in the supposed defeat of a clearly defined enemy, but a postmodern revolution can never have an end. With no clearly defined boundaries or universal structures, postmodern revolutions must continue perpetually.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While this may sound like a frightening prospect, it is not. Instead of endless conflict a perpetual revolution involves dialectal action. The dialect can be described as a perpetual movement of opposing ideas which are mediated with each other; a simultaneous destruction of outdated structures and a preservation of their beneficial qualities, all mediated with new ideas (Jay, 1996, Kellner, 1992). The aim of a dialectal movement is not the attainment of a universal truth, but rather the sparking of social action; it is the constant quest to annihilate what is obsolete and repressive in a given society. Dialectal action is a constant transformative process; it is painful and involves suffering and critique. A modern social movement cannot end with the vanquishing of an enemy, because the enemies are everywhere and nowhere, in the past and the future. Only by realizing the dialectal nature of revolution in a postmodern world, can a social movement be &ldquo;won.&rdquo; The end of modern social movements and revolutions are just their beginning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The purpose of this paper is to apply a dialectal framework to the core tenets of Occupy Wall Street; namely its categorizations of 99%/1%, economic oppression, and Wall Street itself as the source of oppression in an effort to wage a postmodern fight. The enemy is not simply the oppression by the 1%, but the ideological and sociological apparatus behind their oppression. A dialectal analysis will broaden the simple categorizations currently propounded by the Occupy Wall Street movement.&nbsp; Further, the paper will argue that this dialectal analysis can be tied to the United States&rsquo; higher and secondary public education systems to ensure the dialects&rsquo; continual critical powers and effectiveness.</p>
<p>
	The first section of the paper will briefly survey some of the various definitions and ideas surrounding postmodernism. Some of the factors that have contributed to the making of a postmodern global society will be explored.&nbsp; The next section of the paper will some of the roots of this ideological and sociological apparatus behind the dominance of the 1%. Lastly, the paper will explore the aims of Occupy Wall Street, and apply dialectal insights in an effort to wage a postmodern revolution.</p>

<p>
	Modernism has its roots in the Enlightenment which emerged during the 18<sup>th</sup>century in Europe. A modernist paradigm is rooted in reason; the belief in universal structures independent of the mind, the scientific method and logical, cause and effect thinking. Binary conceptions of knowledge are dominant, where societal and natural phenomena are seen in a hierarchal relationship and where one position of the hierarchy is superior to other (i.e. science/humanities, rational/irrational, logical/mystical) (Kellner, 1992).&nbsp; However, it is the idea of representation that is the foundation of modernism (Kellner, 1992). The belief is that societal structures in the form of laws, policies and institutions accurately and truthfully represent the will, aspirations and needs of the people of a society (Bloland, 2005, Kellner, 1992). With careful scientific and empirical investigation, it is believed that absolute or universal laws can be discovered.</p>
<p>
	By the 19<sup>th</sup>century, this scientific knowledge has been fruitfully applied to industry. Science and capitalism were natural allies. Together, capitalism reached a new stage of organization and productivity (Bohman &amp; Deal, 2008, Morgan, 2008). Scientific management of industry became the norm, and the West, with science and industry, remade the world in its image. Further, science and industry were seen as the highest a universal creed; they were the apex of modernism. The West sought to spread these ideas globally (through conquest and annexation) (Morgan, 2008, Weber, 2010).</p>
<p>
	The events of the 20<sup>th</sup>century however, worked to undermine the dominance of the modernist paradigm. First the Great Depression, both globally and in the US, shook the confidence of the free market capitalist system that had predominated for almost three quarters of a century. The First and Second World Wars, and more specifically the atrocities of the holocaust and Hiroshima, shook the seemingly unquestioned faith in science and reason for many. The Nazi death camps were run with machine like precision, executions were compassionless, the battlefield was a showcase for the most destructive weapons man had ever created, and of course, the awesome power of the atomic bomb was unleashed. Later, events such as civil rights, feminism, sexual liberation and movements for homosexual rights called into question the at best paternalistic and at worst racist and sexist dominance of the white Western man (Lemert, 2010). Further, the African and Indian decolonization movements, as well as the Vietnam War and OPEC oil crisis and more recently the events of September 11<sup>th</sup>, propelled the supposed third world countries into the global spotlight as contenders and opponents of the West, and specifically modernism (Lemert, 2010, Peet, 2009). Currently, the growing income disparity in the United States and globally, the disastrous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have further called the modernist paradigm into question. In light of all these events, some thinkers (but by no means all) have argued that modernism has failed, and that society as entered into a state of &ldquo;post-modernity.&rdquo; (Lemert, 2010, Kellner, 1992, Jay, 1996).</p>
<p>
	While postmodernism is not a coherent school of thought, some commonalities can be discerned. Postmodernism dispenses with the notions of objective reality, hierarchies, and of representation (Bess &amp; Dee, 2008, Lemert, 2010). Instead, postmodernists believe that an objective reality does not exist, only subjective interpretations. As such, the western paradigm of science, capitalism and reason is no longer the universal norm, but only one of many subjective interpretations. Further, the subjectivist positions of those with power or with authority are manifested by various structures, such as language, policies and institutions and taken to be objective; as the West has done to other nations and minorities at home. The subsequent objectifying of these one-sided subjective positions and their manifestation usually leads to the marginalization of those without power by the creation of hierarchies. Postmodernists attack the notions of hierarchies because they see all forms of inquiries and cultures as valid (Bess &amp; Dee, 2008).</p>
<p>
	As mentioned above, the foundation of modernism is the notion of representation. So it is no surprise that this notion came under heavy fire by postmodernists; postmodernists question if any structure or language can accurately represent what is portends to represent, and who has the right to represent who. Many feel that the West can no longer claim the dominance of the modernist paradigm. Science and capitalism, while productive, have disfigured the world, dominated oppressed populations, and destroyed native economies, wreaked economic havoc on billions while enriching a few thousand. The current income disparity in the United States and the subsequent actions of the Occupy Wall Street are evidence of this.</p>

<p>
	The Occupy Wall Street movement began on September 17<sup>th</sup>, 2011 (which is also constitution day) in New York City as an organized protest against the economic inequality in the United States. It was organized by a Canadian non-profit organization called Adbusters and was inspired by the Arab Spring movements, as well as the Spanish Acampadas (Adbusters, 2011). Adbusters defines itself as a &ldquo;network of culture jammers&rdquo; which seeks to alter the way information flows in society. Specifically, they take aim at what they see as a culture driven by a rampant consumerism, a culture fixated on consumer goods.</p>
<p>
	As mentioned earlier, the Occupy Wall Street movement specifically has taken aim at the growing economic in equality in the United States. According to many estimates, 95% of the wealth in the United States is held by 5% of the population (Fowler, 2009). Recently, the Washington Post ran an article titled &ldquo;Slipping from the Middle Class.&rdquo; The author, Michael Fletcher describes how the notion of &ldquo;downward mobility,&rdquo; or Americans slipping out of the middle class bracket, is becoming common in the United States. The middle class bracket is determined by income between 32,000 and 64,000 dollars a year.&nbsp; As mentioned earlier, according to the US Census, in 2000 the median household income rose by roughly 1,000 dollars for the lowest fifth of the population and 3,000 dollars for the second lowest fifth. By contrast, during the same period, the median household income rose by over 27,000 dollars for highest fifth and by over 35,000 dollars for the richest 5% (US Census, 2011). In light of postmodernism, it can be argued that the present capitalist system no longer represents the majority of the American public. As Occupy Wall Street has made clear, the capitalist system really only works for the 1% of the population, not the 99%.</p>
<p>
	The Occupy Wall Street movement has legitimate grievances. However, like all left-wing movements, Occupy Wall Street runs the risk of degenerating into propaganda. As Martin Jay (1996) notes, left-wing intellectuals straddle a precarious line. If and when left-wing scholars decide to descend from their ivory tower and join the masses in social protest, their complex ideas need to be distilled and distributed in accessible form. This is where the risk of propaganda creeps in. Left wing social theorists must somehow keep the intellectual complexity of their theories while making them accessible. The Occupy Wall Street movement has made efforts to ensure the continued vitality and complexity of its theories. There are continued calls for participation, broadening of the decentralized structure, and a call to spread to different facets of society (Occupy Wall Street, 2011).</p>
<p>
	The Occupy Wall Street movement has taken aim primarily the economic oppression of the 99% by the richest 1%. But they cannot simply fight against economic oppression. This economic oppression is a symptom of a much larger oppression, that of social and cultural oppression, and it is this oppression that must be taken aim at. What must be examined is not the simple oppression, but rather the actual unquestioned ethos behind the oppression; the ingrained ethos of capitalism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	<strong>The Ethos of Capitalism: Then and Now&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>
	The capitalist system can be described as a sociological construct because it restructures human behavior and interaction. In a capitalist system, human interactions are reduced to that of buying and selling. The bedrock of the capitalist sociological construct is the atomistic individual. The individual is seen as a consumer, and as the target of persuasion and advertising. The consumer in turn, views the world from a buyer&rsquo;s perspective, always looking for the best deal. More than this however, the atomistic individual becomes the locus of gain. The object of capitalism is to accumulate profit at the expense of others. The notion of a communal good is in some ways incompatible with a capitalist system. This is not to say that all interactions in society are the direct result of capitalism, but capitalism nonetheless has helped to restructure contemporary society and its human actions (Colletti, 1973, Hill, 2006, Overtveldt, 2007, Peet, 2009, Slaughter &amp; Rhodes, 2004). Of course, this state of affairs did not spontaneously occur. Beginning during the later Middle Ages in Europe, we can begin to detect the emergence of capitalism as a sociological construct, or what this paper has termed the capitalistic ethos.</p>
<p>
	Colletti (1973) argued that in the medieval era, economics and ethics were still linked; the common good was the end of business transactions. The idea of the atomistic individual was anthemia to most. However, the theories of John Locke changed this conception. Locke separated the connection between ethics and economics, locating property not as the common good, but as an individual attribute. This individual attribute was than sanctioned by nature and god in the social contract. Here, Colletti argued that Bernard Mandeville, a Scottish philosopher and economist of the 17<sup>th</sup>century, realized this problem, this cleavage between ethics and economics, but instead of repairing it, he endorsed it as a sign of modernity and the emergence of a free market system. Mandeville argued, unabashedly, that in order for there to be wealth, there must be poverty.&nbsp; Here, Colletti juxtaposes atomistic individualism to the common good. He cites Mandeville as one of the first to recognize this problem; how can there be a common good if society is built on &ldquo;private vice?&rdquo; He sees Mandeville throwing down the gauntlet for the modern era, and posing an as of yet unanswered question. Working off Mandeville, Adam Smith&rsquo;s notion of the &ldquo;invisible hand,&rdquo; saw harmony resulting from the chaotic interactions of self-interested individuals. Capitalism, with the individual at its core, was a harmonious system that promoted the benefit of all (Colleti, 1973).</p>
<p>
	Weber (2010) argued that the present capitalist ethos was born during the protestant reformation, specifically with the advent of the free market. Buying and selling, the acquisition of wealth became not simply ones&rsquo; vocation, but a holy calling. The best way to serve God was through ones vocation. Further, success in ones vocation was a sign of blessedness, and ultimately a sign that one was destined for heaven (Weber, 2010). By the 18<sup>th</sup>century, Puritans, Methodists, Pietists and Baptists all embodied this capitalist ethos in America and Europe. In short, capitalism was divinized (Weber, 2010).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	This capitalistic ethos was a dominant feature of the American social fabric since the time of the American Revolution. The Revolution itself was a capitalist endeavor, fought largely to secure economic rights and free trade (Breen, 2004, Nash, 1986). The constitution itself is in many respects an economic document, which enshrines the notions of free trade and business through individual liberty. The life, liberty and above all property of citizens were to be free of government influence (Breen, 2004 Nash, 1986). The French Revolution (excluding the Reign of Terror) was similar in respect to its American counterpart. The French Revolution was a victory for the rising class of French bourgeoisie over the nobility. The revolution of 1789, and subsequent revolutions and events of 1791, 1795, the Napoleonic era, and the revolutions of 1830 and 1848 liberated French business interests from their archaic feudal regulations (Sewall, 1985). Capitalism, with the bourgeoisie and merchant class as its primary bearers, was now ascendant in Europe and America.</p>
<p>
	As industrialization took hold in Europe and America during the course of the 19<sup>th</sup>century, the capitalist ethos became engrained in the West (Hobsbawm, 1962). The capitalist ethos found its highest expression in the doctrine of Social Darwinism, which called for the economic survival of the fittest. Capitalism, the relation between buyer and seller, the acquisition of profits, was now both religious and biological (Hobsbawm, 1962). The poor were not only barred from salvation, but they were biologically unfit as well.</p>
<p>
	Some of the more destructive notions of capitalism were tempered by the events of the Great Depression and World War Two, but by the late 1940s, capitalism was on the rise again, especially in the United States (Overtveldt, 2007). In response to the liberal new deal economic policies that dominated American politics and economics since the 1930s a counter economic movement began to emerge in academia. Drawing on the notions of eighteenth century liberalism, economists at the University of Chicago and elsewhere developed what later came to be known as neoliberalism. At the heart of the neoliberal paradigm is the fact that the market can solve all social, as well as economic problems. This harkened back to Smith&rsquo;s notion of the invisible hand. This glorification of the market increasingly found a wide audience in the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup>century, as capitalism and the market were seen as bulwarks against the Soviets and communism (Overtvelt, 2007).</p>
<p>
	However, it was Ronald Reagan and the conservative revolution of the 1980s that gave neoliberalism its highest expression (Diggins, 2007, Fowler, 2009). Diggins suggests that Reagan in many ways believed capitalism and the pursuit of material wealth to be an almost spiritual endeavor. Reagan&rsquo;s theory of &ldquo;supply-side&rdquo; economics saw the rise of a decadent, materialistic class of Americans. Diggins states that Reagan believed that with the added wealth, people would invest more, and ultimately work harder, thus creating more wealth. And this has been the mantra of republicans and conservatives ever since. The free-market is thought to be the most efficient mechanism for promoting not only economic harmony, but social harmony as well (Overtveldt, 2007). Neoliberalism is market reductionism. Individuals are reduced to consumers and targets for advertisement. All is reduced to the market.</p>
<p>
	Seen in light of capitalisms&rsquo; development from the Reformation onward, neoliberalism embodies many of the traits of capitalism that have emerged in the past; capitalism as a religious calling, as producer of harmony, the individual over the community, capitalism as biology etc. This does not imply a teleological design, but it does point to a historical development. This capitalistic ethos is dominant today, and through globalization, is not just limited to the West. And it is this notion of a capitalist ethos that Occupy Wall Street must contend with.</p>
<p>
	The simplistic 99% versus 1% obscures the complex and deep rooted nature of capitalism, not just as an economic system, but as a social and cultural system. Capitalism, since the Reformation, has been restructuring human interactions. Viewed through a capitalistic lens, people are seen as consumers, all human relationships take the form of business interactions, the weak die and the strong survive. It is no wonder 99% exploit the 1%, that the 1% view the 99% as weak, not fit to survive, as destined to be dominated, as biologically and socially inferior etc. This is not to say that oppression is a distinct feature of capitalism; oppression has existed since the beginning of time in non-capitalistic societies. What marks the present oppression is the fact that it is bureaucratically and more efficiently administered, and despite the philosophical advances in areas such as human and civil rights, the oppression grows daily. Further, oppression does not need to be brutal or painful; many citizens in oppressive societies live comfortable lives, but are nonetheless oppressed (Adorno &amp; Horkheimer, 1969, Jay, 1996, Kellner, 1992). Occupy Wall Street cannot simply fight economic oppression, but rather it must take aim at the capitalist ethos which makes oppression seem natural and destined for 99% of the worlds population.</p>
<p>
	Capitalistic oppression is amorphous in a postmodern society. Baudrillard (1993) likened modernity to an orgy, where all spheres of life (economics, sexuality, politics etc) have collapsed on each other. With modern technology, production of not only goods but ideas is viral. There are no boundaries, there is just production. The capitalistic ethos of the capitalist system has become autonomous, and a part of all facets of society, it is no longer confined simply to economics. Capitalism has now totalized the world in its own image (Baudrillard, 1993). Oppression in a postmodern society is not a simple binary relationship between oppressed and oppressor, rather oppression is amorphous and it must be fought in like manner. Specifically, the capitalistic ethos outlined above is rooted in different spheres of society, from religion, to economics, to politics etc. The capitalistic ethos pulsates in this orgy and dominates in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>
	Using Baudrillard&rsquo;s (1993) analysis of capitalism as a jumping off point, we can better see the amorphous nature of capitalistic oppression in a postmodern society. With its viral spread across collapsed societal boundaries, the capitalistic ethos has restructured all human relations and interactions to that of buyer and seller, all is an advertisement. The individual is pitted against other individuals, all fight for profit. Further, products (whether ideas or actual tangible products) become tools of domination and oppression which help to mold the perceptions, desires and values for groups in society. Politicians, sex, education and even religion are sold and used to push and pull various sections of the population in different ways. The 1% dominates the 99% like objects, but this is only one type of domination in a vast web of domination which comprises contemporary society. Once the fluid nature of oppression, specifically the capitalistic ethos is defined, we can begin fight back.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Fighting Back</strong></p>
<p>
	Again, to reiterate, Occupy Wall Street cannot simply fight oppression, but it must fight the source of this oppression, which is the capitalistic ethos which has existed in one form or another for centuries. And the most effective method for combating this deeply engrained ethos may be the dialect. Dialectal thinking was derived from Hegel and Marx and further elucidated by the School of Critical Theory. Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement could promote dialectal thinking in all facets of everyday life. As mentioned earlier, the aim of dialectal reasoning is social action, not immutable truths (Jay, 1996, Kellner, 1992). Indeed, dialectal thinking is opposed to immutable truths.</p>
<p>
	Dialectal thinking is characterized by a refusal to rest; it involves a complex understanding of all historical and social phenomena (Jay, 1996, Kellner, 1992). Instead of fragmenting these phenomena and looking at each separately however, dialectal thinking views all social and historical phenomena as a totality. Dialectal analysis elides well with a postmodern frame, because as mentioned earlier, postmodernism collapsed the boundaries between societal institutions. This cuts to the heart of the capitalistic ethos; it cannot be viewed in a fragmentary manner, as solely a product of economic conditions. Rather, the capitalist ethos must be seen as interplay between social, historical, and even biological and religious factors that influence each other. It must also be situated historically. The ultimate foundation of the dialect is transformation and emancipation; the emancipation of man from oppressive structures through a continual process of transformation to a higher level of social reality. Hegel and Marx used the term <em>aufheben</em> to denote a simultaneous destruction and preservation of existing structures (preserving what is beneficial in them, and destroying what is oppressive). New developments, ideas and theories would then be mediated, or what was called <em>Vermittung </em>in German (Jay, 1996, Kellner, 992). Once the dialect destroys, it creates something new. This is why the recognition of post modernity is crucial. Without it, simple dichotomous categorizations will abound, and the well meaning fight will only yield modest and ultimately impotent results. Only with the recognition of fluid boundaries of societal institutions, and sources of oppression, can Occupy Wall Street truly bring about change.</p>
<p>
	While the capitalist ethos is inculcated in a variety of different ways (media, government, military etc) one of the most subtle and powerful inculcation methods is the American education system (both secondary and higher education). And it is the American education system where the Occupy Wall Street can ignite dialectal change. Of course as it stands right now, the American education system is one of the most effective, and subtle perpetuators of the capitalistic ethos (Hill, 2006). Mathematics and science are elevated, while disciplines in the humanities are relegated to a second tier status in both higher education and secondary education. Science and math, while valuable, are bound up with the dominant modernist paradigm, since modernism holds that only empirical investigation can yield truth. Further, scientists yield profitable inventions and discoveries, in both the civilian and defense spheres.</p>
<p>
	Of course, even history and other disciplines in the humanities are taught like math and science. At the secondary level, history is sheared of its ability to inspire critical thinking and analysis; instead it is fragmented into memorizable pieces to be regurgitated on standardized tests. The tests themselves yield tremendous profits to private companies (Hill, 2002, Post). Students are ranked like workers with their GPAs, and they must perform like workers, turning out products for marketability (mainly themselves for prospective colleges, their GPA and tests scores etc). Similarly; higher education is considered the gateway to economic prosperity, if for no other reason than providing the human capital to fuel the global economy and to ensure the United State&rsquo;s dominant position on the world stage. Nationally and globally, this economic utilitarian view of higher education is flourishing (Maassen &amp; Stensaker, 2010, Fowler, 2009, Pusser, 2008).&nbsp; While the humanities are by no means forgotten, they are increasingly relegated to second tier disciplines. History, philosophy and literary criticism do not have the potential to yield profit like mathematics, engineering and the sciences do. American secondary and higher education are thoroughly imbued with the capitalistic ethos. So, using legislative means to influence public education are almost always sure to fail. Educational politics, at the federal, state, and local levels are anything but rational endeavors (Farmer, 2009, Fowler, 2009). Rather, they are battlegrounds for special interests and lobbyists, as well as virgin territory for corporations and businesses (Hill, 2006). Thus it will be necessary to circumnavigate the established structure.</p>
<p>
	Education should be liberation from the oppressive strictures of society, whether they be religious, economic or political (Nietzsche, 2004). If the modernist notion of education continues to dominate, if education continues to be solely an arm of the global economy, than secondary and higher education may lose its liberating quality and simply become training and indoctrination, it they have not already. Occupy Wall Street can infiltrate the education system at all levels, by sustaining contracts with students, teachers and professors. Occupy Wall Street can make the education system dialectal; and the dialect can be turned on the capitalist ethos that permeates American society from all directions. Teachers, while performing their mandated tasks of teaching to the various standardized tests, can go above and beyond the test. In unison with other teachers, students and the occupy movement itself, teachers, either overtly, or more likely covertly, can inculcate dialectal thinking in their students. The same can be said of college professors. The aim is not to teach the correctness of the Occupy Wall Street movement, but rather to teach how to criticize every facet of society and liberate it from the corrosive influence of the capitalist ethos.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;With dialectal knowledge, students, teachers and professors can work within the system to change and reconstruct it. This is a postmodern fight. As such, it must be waged against a variety of opponents, not the simple and misleading characterization of the 1% as the sole enemy.&nbsp; To wage a fight against the 1% and not the indoctrinating and fluid forces behind the 1% would be to wage a fight against the symptom and not the disease itself.</p>
<p>
	The dialect must attack all forms of domination, in all spheres; it must expose the interconnected nature of domination as well. Domination cannot be fragmented into separate atomized spheres (i.e. economic oppression of the 99% etc). A few examples of the interconnected nature of domination will suffice; the politicians that are sold to the US people are puppets of business lobbyists and other business interests,&nbsp; sex (especially teenage sex) is a commodity on which the cosmetic, advertising and birth control industries subsist, media and government&nbsp; are entwined to create propaganda, the religious right has a tremendous influence in politics and on candidates, corporations and defense contractors reap huge profits off of supposedly patriotic wars funded by taxpayer dollars (or just paid for with credit), &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; are created by the media and their stories are sold (i.e. professional sports athletes, exaggerated war stories etc). Corporations and businesses net billions a year in educational products and software, of which the pedagogical value is unquestioned. All of these instances are examples of the interconnected nature of domination and oppression.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decentralized nature of the Occupy Wall Street movement lends itself perfectly to fighting a postmodern revolution. If different occupy groups choose to wage this fight, the individual groups can maintain contacts with local students, teachers and professors. A true revolutionary impulse must come from the bottom up, as the occupy movement has. Now it must continue to spread, but always in a decentralized manner. All that is needed is a few determined and insightful revolutionaries to spread the ideas covertly. Occupy protesters cannot simply mouth &ldquo;truths&rdquo; that appeared on face book, or the movement will quickly degenerate into left-wing propaganda.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The essence of dialectal thinking is not providing truth but providing the means to question all supposed truths. Informal teaching sessions could be held for students, teachers and professors, either in person or online, informal sessions can also be run in conjunction with local students, teachers and professors. These sessions could highlight the amorphous nature of postmodern society and methods to question it, i.e. why and exactly how does the 1% oppress the 99%? Who composes the 1%? How can we historicize the growing income inequality? In what ways has the capitalist ethos penetrated society? What do the terms community and republic mean and is a communal vision compatible with capitalism? Again, there are no prescribed answers, but penetrating questions that would emerge as a result of discussions. The answers to the questions (which may be more questions) are then mediated (<em>Vermittung</em>) into the structure of the Occupy Movement, and into the further critiques and analysis of society. From these new vantage points, the dialect would continue.</p>
<p>
	In their general assemblies and group discussions, some of the occupy movements employ a technique known as collective thinking, which is not based on adversarial argumentation, but rather on consensus building. The object of collective thinking is not to beat an adversary and prove a point, but to create a new and higher position in conjunction with others (Occupy Wall Street, 2011). This creation is the essence of the dialect. However, the created positions can never become ossified, but must always be open to further transformation. This collective thinking technique, with the capitalist ethos and its multifaceted points of dissemination as its object of discussion, can be implanted into local educational institutions. Students, teachers and professors could examine the interconnected nature and historical continuity of current societal problems. Of course, this dialectic method, transposed to the American education system, cannot be the answer to the Occupy Wall Street movement; it can only be the beginning. The answer Occupy Wall Street is searching for may be a question that ignites a revolution.</p>

		In examining the issue of homelessness and poverty we cant overlook the current state of the economy and how best to provide access to economic opportunity&nbsp; for those living in poverty and near poverty. A strong economy depends on an educated workforce. As a result, we must provide a good education at the elementary and high school level plus make higher education affordable. There has to be an increase in affordable green technology homes. There also has to be a greater understanding of making affordable homes in a way that promotes a healthy community. The current income gap demands action; we have to create a more balanced society but that will depend on political leadership.</p>

		<strong><u>Part A. Reducing the rate of Homelessness and Poverty is important</u></strong></p>
	<p>
		A safe home, sufficient healthcare and ample food are three of the most fundamental needs for a human being. The rising rate of poverty is the biggest challenge for this nation. The current economic challenge has compounded the matter. According to the U.S Census 42, 868,163 Americans lived below the poverty level in 2009 by 2010 it was 46, 215,956. In Florida the percentage of those living below poverty was 16.0 or more according to the U.S Census. In Washington State it was between 13.0 and 15.9. The rate of poverty and the struggle to live above it has lead to some changes in the way Americans live. According to the NY Times <em>&ldquo;Four million additional Americans found themselves in poverty in 2009, with the total reaching 44 million or one in seven residents. Millions more were surviving only because of expanded unemployment insurance and other assistance &ldquo;.</em>&nbsp; The author of this article from the NY Times goes on to say that one way Americans are changing their life&rsquo;s in light of the economic downturn is to share homes with siblings, parents and even non relatives. Included in the trend of multifamily households is James Davis. According to the NY Times Mr. Davis, <em>&ldquo;Lost his job as a package handler for Fed Ex in February 2009. As he ran out of money, he and his 2 year old daughter moved in with his mother about a year ago.&rdquo; </em>Another story is that of Danise Sanders who according to the NY Times her and&rdquo; her three children have been sleeping in the living room of her mother and sisters one bedroom apartment in San Pablo Cali., for the last month, with no end in sight. They doubled up after the bank foreclosed on her landlord, forcing her to move. &ldquo;Poverty with no hope to get out of it is a problem. It&rsquo;s a problem because it leads to discontent and a loss of spirit. If it continues to grow in large numbers it could lead to a questioning a system that no longer works for them. Poverty grows out of lack of income mobility. Jason DeParle is the author of an article in the New York Times titled <strong>Harder for Americans to Rise from Lower Rungs.</strong>&nbsp; According to the article <em>&ldquo;Benjamin Franklin did it. Henry Ford did it. And American life is built on the faith that others can do it, too: rise from humble origins to economic heights. &lsquo; Movin; on up,&rsquo; George Jefferson style, is not only a sitcom song but a civil religion. &ldquo;However</em>, the author goes on to say that we enjoy less income mobility than other developed nations. The statistics for income mobility shows a lack of promise for the United States.&nbsp; A report by Markus Jantti an economist at a Swedish university found that 8 percent of American men at the bottom rose to the top fifth compared to 12 percent in Britain and 14 percent of Danes. In the same study Mr. Jantti found that 42 percent of Americans raised in the bottom fifth of income stayed there as adult. This was done in comparison to Denmark with 25 percent and British 30 percent. We cannot and should not accept the argument that those in poverty are there because of their own fault or any other excuse. Poverty projects a bad image of our country. It threatens economic mobility which has provided hope for many and is part of the American Dream. There is a high monetary cost to this national tragedy in terms of real money and spirit. As a result, we have to get serious about this issue. Using different tools we can significantly reduce poverty and homelessness or at the very lease provide an opportunity for people to keep their homes.</p>
	<p>
		Executive Director of Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness recently state that:<em>&rdquo; Housing people is more cost-effective, and brings us more immediately to good outcomes for those families and individuals, than building more shelter.&quot; </em>&nbsp;The question is how long will it continue and how much will it really save over time. There is also the question of maintaining the new homes up to date. Those that assist homeless individuals must make sure that families or individuals are provided with support once in housing. My fear with housing first is that a rush in placing homeless individuals in housing will make the matter worst. The Institute for Children. Poverty and Homelessness was critical of NYC aggressive re-housing saying that &ldquo;<em>Certainly many families move on to permanent housing with success, but an increasing percentage have not and cannot. They lack the self-sufficiency skills such as work experience and education to obtain, let alone maintain gainful employment &ldquo;. </em>Those families or individual who lack certain self sufficiency skills should get the help so that permanent housing can be possible<em>. </em>Ultimately every person and family has the right to life in a secure and permanent home. Although I don&rsquo;t think shelters are long term solutions they still need to be maintained. Many Americans are having difficulty hanging on because their wage is less than the cost of maintaining a home. This reality brings me to the next question, how to build and keep housing affordable around the country and in particular Massachusetts where I reside.</p>

		When constructing a home everything from land to material needs to be affordable in order to pass on the savings to the consumer. I believe that building green will save a lot of money in construction and upkeep. Government at the federal and state level should create a way for organizations like Build It Green to construct more green homes with the help of private and public professionals. There has to be an emphasis on construction technology to build for efficient homes with less costly materials. In the Bob Vila website it&rsquo;s stated that:<em>&rdquo; An experienced builder can help the homebuyer keeps costs down through careful design and material selection. This process is called &quot;value-engineering&quot; and, as a buyer, it is in your best interest to find a builder who thoroughly understands it. But while the building industry certainly</em> <em>Benefits from innovations in materials and methods, the independent builder is generally not able to have much of an impact on overall housing affordability</em>&rdquo;.&nbsp; I think that community land trust groups are an essential part of addressing the homelessness issue. Furthermore, the tax incentive to buy homes should be extended. There should be careful planning in how architectural design will revitalize a community. The idea that design plays an important role in developing a sense of stewardship for the community is reflected by an article written in a NY Newspaper on the Housing Partnership Network website by Justine Davidson &ldquo;<em>If ever architecture needed a shot of altruism, it does now, The boom seduced many excellent architects into turning out ever- pricier baubles and feats of vertiginous engineering, but the world requires modest space that, in theory meticulous simplicity, can lend difficult lives a little more grace.</em> &ldquo; There are many examples of designs that helped lend grace to those with difficult lives. An architect named Anna Heringer went to Bangladesh and found a way to improve on an ancient technique to build village schools. In the Bronx construction has begun on Via Verde which is an affordable green housing complex. Andres Lepik is a curator at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) he stated that <em>&ldquo;Design can help people take ownership of the spaces that exist to serve them. Sure, the homeless can find refuge in miserable shelters, and children can learn to read in dingy cinderblock boxes. But good architects can give people paces they want to go &ndash; places where they can belong &ldquo;</em></p>

		I believe that when housing and community planning are done in a smart way everyone benefits. On Thursday June 24<sup>th</sup>, 2010 there was a report published on the Eastsider about a housing developer who wants to construct a big project in a low income neighborhood. Although it will provide housing for a lot of low income families there are those who were worried about density. Another criticism is there won&rsquo;t be any architectural creativity to inspire care for the buildings or green space. For developers construction within cities prevents sprawl and will stop exurban growth. A good start for development is establishing necessary services around them such as public transportation, supermarkets and health services. Smart housing must go hand in hand with smart development.&nbsp; In order to develop in a smart and sustainable way there was to be political will, data to allocate resources appropriately along and long term planning.</p>

		<strong><u>Part B: It&rsquo;s the Economy Silly</u></strong></p>
	<p>
		<em>A quality tax reform will have the effect of lessening the tax burden on the and middle class while spurring innovation in key areas of our economy for long term growth and stability such as green technology. </em></p>
	<p>
		I don&rsquo;t think that lowering corporate tax is a good idea nor do I believe there should be an exaggerated tax increase. When talk about tax reform there is typically an allusion to making it simple. But we need to look the issue of tax reform differently. At a time when the United States is facing fierce competition for the global markets we should be focusing on how tax reform will spur innovation. According to Robert D. Atkinsons who is the author of <strong>Effective Corporate Tax Reform in the Global Innovation Economy </strong>the definition of innovation economics goes as following <em>&ldquo;The overarching goal of economic policy generally, and tax policy specifically, is not to facilitate the efficient allocation of scarce goods and services by reducing distortions, but rather to spur the effective creation of new goods and services and increase productivity through robust innovation policies. &ldquo;</em> One of the recommendations written by Robert D. Akins is to broaden the credit for collaborative energy related research to any area of collaborative research and to expand the credit. Besides sharing the findings of the research companies are more likely to collaborate on this matter as it exposes them to less of a lost. We need a tax system that is fare and spurs innovation. Mr.Atkinson rightfully so points out to the importance of making sure American workers get the skills needed to compete in the modern globalized worlds. The current regressive tax system has led to a selected few to pay little to no taxes at the expense of the majority. The website MotherJones.com posted several highly indicative charts showing the gap in income and who pays what in taxes:</p>

	<p>
		<strong><em>The image above is courtesy of Motherjones.com</em></strong></p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;From this graph you can see the top one-hundredth of one percent make an average of $27 million per household. The average income for the bottom 90 percent of us is $31,244. The amount of income for the wealthy after taxes is untouched but for the rest the story is different as indicated by data provided by MotherJones.com. The following chart indicates the distribution of economic control:</p>

	<p>
		it&rsquo;s clear that that the top earners don&rsquo;t need more money at the expense of the rest of us. Green building is an area with a lot of potential for entrepreneurship</p>
	<p>
		Nathan Brown is the author of <strong>Three Reasons Why Green Building Could Jump start the Economy</strong>. According to Mr.Brown<em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no secret that the construction market has been in a slump for the past two years. Home values are at an all time low as well. In fact, the Zillow Home Value Index has now fallen 26 % in five years which is a larger decline than that during the great depression. &ldquo;</em>As suggested by Mr.Brown one of reasons behind why green building could jumpstart the economy is that non residential building market is estimated to reach about $145 billion in new construction by 2015. It&rsquo;s understandable that non residential buildings will go green as it saves money and it&rsquo;s a great public relations move. Most importantly this could provide the boost need in the construction market which could leak to residential housing. It will also spur innovation in construction that could create savings in materials. The second reason is a rise in the use of energy management market. According to Mr. Brown <em>&ldquo;This type of technology that detects environmental factors and building characteristics in order to automatically regulate energy usage. Otherwise known as &lsquo;smart buildings&rsquo; this technology will, for example, adjust thermostats and turn off lights during low occupancy hours.&rdquo; </em>A third reason is an in increase in incentives which in the view of Mr. Brown has made it more affordable for developers and homeowners.&nbsp; I think incentives have indeed gotten better but more needs to be done. One of the things I have been advocating in relation to affordable housing is exploring the materials for housing construction. Ben&nbsp; Sandzer Bell&nbsp; is the creator of CO2Bambu and according to Green America his mission behind this company is to create <em>&ldquo; An eco-conscious enterprise that can provide lasting housing and economic change&rdquo;</em>. In the Green Economy article it&rsquo;s explained how Mr. Bell had to try hard to convince farmers not to throw away the bamboo. The work he is doing in Nicaragua is really amazing. The great thing about this business is that farmers are trained to grow and collect the bamboo. In turn jobs are created and it leads to a better care for the environment. Other benefits are that CO2Bambu only buys from bamboo seeds from Nicaraguans trained in seed collection and maintenance and donates seeds to local farmers that grow seedlings and transplant bamboo in reforestation projects of which 60,000 plants have been planted in 2.5 years. The reforestation re-establishes riverbeds and other forested areas which helps to improve the quality of water, retains the soil and natural habitat. At the rate the world population is going we can&rsquo;t sustain the current economic model where value is simply judge by how much we have without giving second thoughts to the possibility of running out of sources. We are digging our own grave unless we find a solution and find it fast. With this in mind by marrying the Innovation economic theory and the great promise of a green economy I have come up with the term Greenconomics. Sustainable and affordable energy could free up a substantial amount of money for low income and middle class families which will allow them to meet other needs. It will also cut pollution in our air and water which will lower health related problems. Green economy has the power to lower the cost of building new homes by lowering the cost of materials. For those caught in natural disaster it will make rebuilding easier. With affordable sustainable energy and</p>
	<p>
		other goods people could have more capital to invest and buy things. With stable and sustainable demand there could be long term growth. Another possible effect is that it could finally lead to greater income equality. In the long run we could have a larger and more stable middle class.</p>

		&nbsp;Cities across the nation have made significant progress in living green. According to sustainlane.com Portland, Oregon was ranked the greenest city in the country. <img src=""file:///C:\DOCUME~1\hmiranda\LOCALS~1\Temp\msohtml1\01\clip_image009.png"" />&nbsp;<strong><em>The image above is courtesy of SustainLane: The 2008 US City Rankings</em></strong></p>
	<p>
		New York Citywas ranked 5th in the 2008 listing of the greenest city. Green America offers some insightful thoughts on the Green economy. One of the issues we face in this country is dependence and some would say addiction to oil. Green energy as well pointed out by Green America offers a chance to end dependence on oil while living in a clean environment. Renewable energy has the potential to reduce the cost of energy consumption.&nbsp; With a reduction in cost for energy consumption it will free other resources and allow people to live better life&rsquo;s. According to a blog or article on GreenAmerica.com written in 2009 <em>&ldquo; A crucial starting place to rejuvenate our economy is to focus on energy. Its time to call on the superheroes of the green energy revolution- energy efficiency, solar and wind power, and plug in hybrids and out their synergies to work in rapid, large scale deployment. This is a powerful way to jumpstart the economy, spur job creation ( with jobs that can&rsquo;t be outsourced), declare energy independence, and claim victory over the climate crisis.&rdquo;</em> The most interesting idea that is worth exploring is a clean energy victory bond. This could be a way to get the public behind a movement in an effective way. Green America stated that <em>&ldquo;Clean energy victory bonds. Modeled after victory bonds in WWII, Americans would buy these bonds from the federal government to invest in large scale deployment of green energy projects, with particular emphasis in low income communities hardest hit by the broken economy. These would be long term bonds paying an annual interest rate, based in part on the energy and energy savings that the bonds generate.&rdquo;</em> Consumers have an important role to play in creating a green economy. By choosing to buy green it creates a demand for green technology. Cities and states also play an important role in strengthening the green economy. What we are missing in this country is a clear long term plan not only for energy but to create a green sustainable nation. Innovation economic theory could provide a solid foundation for a green economy.</p>
	<p>
		I was first introduced to the idea of Innovation economics by Robert D. Atkinson and David B. Audretsch who are writers of the article Innovation Economics as an Alternative to Neoclassical Economics. Innovation Economics is a new economic doctrine which opposes both the conservative and liberal neoclassical economic theories. According to the article, the new realities of a global, knowledge based economy in the 21<sup>st</sup> century require a <em>&ldquo;New approach to economic policy based more on smart support for the building blocks of innovation and entrepreneurship and less on capital accumulation, budget surpluses, or social spending. Without an economic theory and doctrine that match the new realities it will be very hard policymakers to take the steps needed to foster economic growth. &ldquo;Mr</em>. Audretsch goes on to say that Innovation theory reformulates conventional model of economic augmentation so that knowledge, technology, entrepreneurship, and innovation are situated at the center of the model rather than seen as sovereign forces fundamentally impervious by the policy. The two primary tenants of this new economic hypothesis according to Mr. Audretsch are that it&rsquo;s of outmost importance for economic policy architects to set a goal of higher productivity and greater innovation. The second is that markets relying on price indication alone will not always be successful as smart public private partnerships in spurring higher productivity and greater innovation. Before Mr. Audretsch makes his case that Innovation Economics is the wave of the future he explains principles of the Neoclassical Economic dogma. The first principle is that accumulation of capital drives economic growth. The second principle is that economic growth is realized by maximizing allocative efficiency. Third is a focus on market and prices; in other words &ldquo;<em>Allocative efficiencies revolves around the responsiveness of economic agents- firms and consumers to price signals. Consequently, neoclassical economists tend to rely on mathematical models rather than on actual studies of how businesses, industries and national economies work. And their emphasis is more on factors like interest rates, currency values, inflation, and other monetary factors than on factors like the rate by which firms are developing and adopting new technologies or the effect of culture on entrepreneurship. &ldquo;</em>Fourth is that the economy tends to equilibrium. Such event occurs when<em>&ldquo;A market price is established through competition such that the amount of goods or services south by buyers is equal to the amount of goods or services produced by sellers. Because the economy tends toward equilibrium in the neoclassical view, the main task of economic policy is simply to reduce artificial barriers and impediments to market equilibrium, particularly by </em></p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		<em>ensuring that prices are aligned with costs. &ldquo;</em>The final one is that individuals and firms are rational maximizers and act in response to motivation. Indeed as well noted by Mr. Audretsch both sides of the neoclassical economic doctrine hold some truths; <em>&ldquo;Markets are important, especially at the macroeconomic level (e.g., markets for electricity, for gasoline, for &ldquo;widgets&rdquo; generally). Helping to ensure that prices usually match cots can be important to promoting allocative efficiency, especially when there are little or no compensating benefits to productivity or innovation.&rdquo; </em>The author goes on to say that tax rates at too high a level can limit enticements. Budget deficits at too high a level can limit capital accessibility. Despite these &lsquo;truths&rsquo; there are some flaws which were pointed by Mr. Audretsch. Two of the most significant are that the economy progressively more doesn&rsquo;t tend to reach equilibrium. As rightfully pointed out by Mr. Audretsch it&rsquo;s hard to reach equilibrium in the economy when technology is changing at a dizzying paste. For example it did not take long for the cassette player to be replaced by the CD player and eventually the IPod which created the iTunes store and spurred innovation in how music is marketed and sold. It did not take long for us to move from a desktop computer to a laptop and now the tablets. The tablets spurred other companies to make their own products and have increase the accessibility of online shoppers to products without doing much work. The other flaw is believing that individuals and firms are balanced actors. This assumption was challenged by Mr. Audretsch author of <strong>The Origin of Wealth</strong>, where he explained that &ldquo;<em>Peoples decisions are affected by a host of &lsquo;problems&rsquo;, including framing biases, difficulties judging risks, superstitious reasoning, and other &lsquo;human; biases. Often, for example, people tend to overestimate the likelihood of low probability events. Finally, research on the process of organizational change and innovation increasingly shows that the process is path depend, locationally specific, and institutionally shaped. New discoveries in the realms of behavioral economics and complexity theory such as these are calling into question the &lsquo;Newtonian&rsquo; simplicity of the neoclassical worldviews. &ldquo;</em>Its not as simple as saying we need to innovate.</p>
	<p>
		The question we need to be asking ourselves is where we want to be ten, twenty, forty years from now as a nation. What type of economy and society do we want to have? Before innovation takes place we need long planning and ability to create the right atmosphere. The right atmosphere is created by making education and job training a priority. A society that is knowledgeable is creative, vibrant and innovative</p>
	<p style=""margin-left: 1.5in"">
		<strong><u>Part C: &nbsp;Education</u></strong></p>
	<p>
		Higher education is important to any country that wants to innovate. The rising cost of American higher education could put it out of reach for many students. As a result, higher education institutions must do more to lower the cost of education in partnership with the government for continual sustainable support of higher education. Education is not the magic cure for poverty but it does provide a strong base. We must do better in high school completion rate, improve the curriculum and improve the learning of students at the higher education level; this is referred to as pre market by Mr. Adkinson. A well educated workforce will attract companies to settle in the United States and spur growth. Jared Bernstein is the author of <strong>Is Education the Cure for Poverty.</strong> In his report he indicated the importance of combining general education with training specific to labor market in the area.</p>
	<p>
		Dan Lips from The Heritage Foundation wrote an article in 2010 called <strong>Ways to Make Higher Education More Affordable</strong>. In the article Mr. Lips proposed many ideas on how to make college affordable. The author is critical of the president&rsquo;s proposal that would cap student loan payments of the borrowers discretionary spending at 10 %. For borrowers whose income is 150 percent of the poverty line none of their income will have to go towards payment of student loans. While it&rsquo;s true that some students will take out more money than they could ever pay back I don&rsquo;t think it tells the whole story. For the majority of students who are of the responsible king even if they take out a modest loan they will have a hard time paying it back. So I support the president&rsquo;s plan but will agree with Mr. Lips in that it doesn&rsquo;t address the root of the problem. The root of the problem is the cost of college going up faster than inflation. The graph below is an estimate by Wells Fargo indicating the rising cost of higher education.</p>
	<p>
		<img src=""file:///C:\DOCUME~1\hmiranda\LOCALS~1\Temp\msohtml1\01\clip_image011.png"" /><strong><em>&nbsp;The image and data above is courtesy of Wells Fargo</em></strong></p>
	<p>
		The focus should be how to lower the overall cost of college while keeping subsidies at a modest level. One idea to lower the cost of college offered by the author is embracing the idea of online learning. According to Mr.Lips &ldquo;<em>Rather than continuing to expand federal subsidies for college students&nbsp; and student&nbsp; loan borrowers, policymakers and private sector should focus on strategies to lower college costs. A promising strategy is to strengthen competition between higher education providers by harnessing the power of technology and online learning. This is already happening in k-12 education. Increasingly, states and school districts are using technology or online learning to improve the delivery and efficiency of elementary and secondary education. &ldquo;I</em> think that harnessing the power of technology could potentially lower the cost of higher education and attract more students to universities offering online options. MIT Opencourseware (OCW) is perhaps the best example of how free online course material can help students learn concepts and therefore save money.</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;According to MIT&rsquo;s open courseware website the school published 50 free courses in 2002. A year later it was 500 courses and the Chinese translation was added. By 2009 1950 courses were published and 225 mirror sites were established around the world. For example, according to the OCW stories section Kunle Adejumo is finishing his fourth year of engineering studies at Ahmadu Bello University located in Zaria, Nigeria. The instability of the country has added more time to Kunle&rsquo;s studies. The university has limited internet access. Luckily Kunle is able to use OCW using his home computer.&nbsp; He has used the lectures at OCW to better understand the material being taught by his professors. Nevertheless, despite the promise of online learning we should make sure that programs offered online are interactive and offer the same deep learning offered in a regular classroom. Along with online learning Mr. Lips proposed the idea of credit by examination programs and goes to say that <em>&ldquo;These programs, similar to Advanced Placement and the College-Level Examination Program, allow students to earn college credit by studying and completing an exam remotely. Through these types of programs, a student can earn college credit through self-study at a fraction of the cost of a traditional college course&rdquo;</em>.&nbsp; Higher education institutions must look for ways to lower operating cost.</p>
	<p>
		The Center for College Affordability and Productivity (CCAP) released a research paper titled <strong>25 Ways to Reduce the Cost of College</strong>. In the report CCAP advocated moving more classes online as a way to reduce the cost of college. They provided many compelling reasons why more courses should be moved online. One of those reasons was<em>&rdquo; The savings that can occur from reduced commuting and room and board cost when students can&rsquo;t take courses from their home&rdquo;</em>. The biggest reason why CCAP advocated for more classes to be moved online is that online classes will decrease the physical space needed to hold classes and offices thus reducing the operational cost in maintaining these services. It will also reduce the cost for universities to update their buildings. I think that CCAP is right in saying that more classes should be moved online. Online classes are convenient and could safe students a lot of money. Technology makes it easy to communicate with one another and allows us to do more with less higher education will have to adjust. Embracing online education could reduce the cost of higher education and lead to students having less student debt. In turn when they leave college options for what to do next won&rsquo;t be so limited. As a result, there could be an explosion of entrepreneurship thus helping the economy. As previously stated online course hold great promise but I would approach it carefully. We all have different learning styles and online education might not work for everyone. Universities need to continued investment in controlling operating cost and increased efficiency. NAICU&nbsp; or the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities is going in the right direction by advocating implementing environmentally friendly systems, increasing partnership efforts, exploring non tuition revenue streams. Other ideas are outsource services, make more efficient administration, assimilate information technology and provide incentives to employees to cut cost. According to Tamar Lewin from the NY Times, <em>&ldquo;Overall, the report found, published college tuition and fees increased 439 percent from 1982 to 2007 while median family income rose 147 percent. Student borrowing has more than doubled in the last decade, and students from lower-income families, on average, get smaller grants from the colleges they attend than students from more affluent families &ldquo;</em> The crushing debt of students who come from low to middle income families is a big obstacle as they try to establish their careers.</p>

		<strong><u>Part D: Perfect Storm</u></strong></p>
	<p>
		In order to have long term prosperity in this country the middle class must be protected. There are still some who falsely believe in the trickle down economics. Believe income mobility and the American dream forms an important part of the American story.</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;The situation with Occupy Wall Street movement, also known as &lsquo;Occupy&rsquo; is the culmination of bad government policies that has widened the wealth gap. It&rsquo;s the middle class that provides stability for our economy. Those that are wealthy are unlikely to invest and spend money if there&rsquo;s no demand. Trickle down economic theory makes no sense because it doesn&rsquo;t provide a good foundation. A shrunken middle class could lead to instability as it creates a feeling of hopelessness. The feeling of hopelessness is created by seeing a small population accumulate and hold on to mass wealth while the majorities are struggling or in poverty. There is an unfortunate assumption by politicians that middle class is replaceable or can be taken for granted. A strong middle class that feels like its status is preserved creates optimism. Optimism leads to innovation and risk taking. It&rsquo;s that risk taking that leads to entrepreneurship and growth in our economy a stable middle class leads to good governance. The middle class gives low income peoples something to aspire to and keeps the wealthy in check.&nbsp; David Madland is the author of Growth and the Middle Class <strong>First Principles: Arguing the Economy</strong> from the Democracy Journal where he stated that <em>&ldquo;The wealthy in unequal societies simply do not consume enough to drive a modern economy. The wealthy save more than the middle class and they consume less. This means that when incomes are stagnant or declining for most people, there isn&rsquo;t enough demand in the economy to encourage productive investment-unless this demand is debt fueled. But debt driven consumption can&rsquo;t last forever: eventually credit stops flowing &ndash;often during an economic crash exacerbated by high levels of consumer debt. And it can take years to recover from deep recession, slowing growth for long periods. &ldquo;</em></p>
	<p>
		In the article written by Mr.Madland there is evidence established by Political Scientist Frederick Solt&rsquo;s 2008 study that&nbsp; inequality from low to high tends to reduce political discussion by percentage 12 points and voting by 13. This study makes sense because it&rsquo;s the middle class that balances everything and without that balance power disproportionally shifts to another. As a result, we should be trying to expand the middle class. Mr. Madland stated that <em>&ldquo;In a 2007 article in The Review of Economics and Statistics. Economist Alberto Chong and Mark Gradstein developed a theoretical model explaining the relationship between inequality and governance and then empirically tested it, finding that economic inequality has a harmful effect on bureaucratic quality, government stability, and democratic accountability. Moreover, actual corruption in government becomes much more common without a strong middle class. In short, a weak middle class hollows out governing practices and institutions, so that the bureaucracy no longer delivers for its citizens. &ldquo;</em></p>
	<p>
		If you haven&rsquo;t gone to the Occupy Wall Street website you should. Once you&rsquo;re in the website a person should look at the declaration made by the movement. It&rsquo;s stated on the Occupy website that <em>&ldquo;As we gather together in solidarity to express a feeling of mass injustice, we must not lose sight of what brought us together. We write so that all people who feel wronged by the corporate forces of the world can know that we are your allies. As one people, united, we acknowledge the reality: that the future of the human race requires the cooperation of its members; that our system must protect our rights, and upon corruption of that system, it is up to the individuals to protect their own rights, and those of their neighbors; that a democratic government derives its just power from the people, but corporations do not seek consent to extract wealth from the people and the Earth; and that no true democracy is attainable when the process is determined by economic power. We come to you at a time when corporations, which place profit over people, self-interest over justice and oppression over equality, run our governments. We have peaceably assembled here, as is our right, to let these facts be known&rdquo;</em>. To this end the movement has so far answered to one of its numerous criticisms. I will be honest and say that I did not think the movement was going to last as long as it has. The danger of the movement loosing steam is still present as there is no leader and thus &lsquo;Occupy&rsquo; movements in different places don&rsquo;t act as one. At the same time those</p>
	<p>
		seemed to be its strengths. The fact that each group acts autonomous means that adaptability to prevent local authorities from ending the movement is strengthened. It also makes it difficult to classify an entire group based on the action of its&rsquo; leaders&rsquo;. The current economic depression continues to fuel the movement. The movement has found some ingenious ways of activism. The most serious threat to this movement is patience.</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings me to an article I found online by Lawrence Meyers who wrote the article <strong>How the Occupy Movement Will End</strong>. In his article he wrote that <em>&ldquo;Eventually the police will move in. Protesters will get hurt of their own accord. There will be recrimination and the strong leaders will dismiss them, reminding everyone that they showed extraordinary patience and waited until something truly had to be done. The MSM will crow and scream over fascist mayoral regimes, and eventually the whole thing will be forgotten well in advance of the election.&rdquo; </em>&nbsp;We are in a deep economic funk, the wealth gap is widening, and students are getting crushed by debt. The level of poverty has increased and corporate influencing our government has become ever present. Bank regulations are being relaxed to the detriment of the economy. For the rich their taxes are being lowered while the middle class and those below are burden with taxes. So no it will not end with people being dislodged from a park. <em>Ideas</em> cannot be arrested fined or forcibly moved. The American dream and income Mobility are intertwine</p>

	<p>
		The American dream has different meanings and some would say that it doesn&rsquo;t exist. In fact according to an article on HowStuff works.com author and social critic George Carlin once famously said <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.&rdquo; </em>Before we explore the American dream I would like to trace its origin. According to Patrick Kiger author of <strong>How the American Dream Works</strong>, &ldquo;<em>Historian James Truslow Adams often receives credit for first popularizing the idea of the American dream. In his 1931 book The Epic of America, Adams described &lsquo;that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement &ldquo;</em>Another individual that made reference to the American dream was John Winthrop in which he alluded to a believe that everyone would have an opportunity to prosper so long as they worked together and follow the biblical traditions. Mr.Kiger stated in his article that gradually, that dream of opportunity evolved in colonist&rsquo;s minds into a God- given right. As rightfully stated by Mr. Kiger to some the American dream means believing that anyone who lives in this country even the most poor can become wealthy. To me the American dream is getting an affordable education, decent and stable job along with having a good retirement. Right now it seems that all those things are being threatened. As previously stated for some the dream never existed. The vast majority if Americans are having difficulty hanging on to that dream.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		John A. Quelch a professor at Harvard Business School stated on his article on the American dream that <em>&ldquo;Our political leaders are guilty of defining the American dream in material terms, in encouraging Americans to live beyond their means in its pursuit, and then putting in place policies that enable them to do so&rdquo;</em>. According to John Quelch both parties are to blame for selling out the American Dream to over spending. Mr. Quelch blames the Right wing politicians for touting lower taxes in trusting that more money in citizen&rsquo;s pocket will lead to spending. The result of this policy is a greater budget deficit. For the left wing Mr. Quelch blames them for <em>&ldquo;Framing the American dream in material terms. They claim the dream is increasingly out of reach of middle class American, pointing to $2000 decline in median family income over the past eight years. On this basis, they justify policies to redistribute wealth so that we can cross subsidize each other&rsquo;s dreams &ldquo;</em></p>
	<p>
		The American dream has led this nation to have great confidence in itself. This in turn has led to extraordinary accomplishments. As a result, &nbsp;we should not loose sight of such dream. We need to revive the dream of affordable higher education and quality education from elementary to high school, good paying jobs and good retirement. The survival of such dreams depends on how well we weather the nations gloom. The Occupy movement has had great success in putting the spotlight on ideals that encompasses the American dream such as education, jobs, affordable healthcare and other issues. Is it time for a third party in congress?</p>
	<p>
		The strength of the Occupy movement is supposing that the system is working against them and is unfair. It comes from a notion that a few at the top are controlling the majority of wealth at the expense of the poor and the middle class. Despite much strength in the movement it will be difficult to survive unless an effective third party is formed. A portion of the reason why we are in such an economic hardship is because of political failure. Democrats and Republicans are the two major political parties but there are other lesser know ones. The list and descriptions of the political parties I am about to mention were provided by politics1.com /parties.</p>
	<p>
		According to the website the party was founded by a former Nixon administration official and one time Conservative Coalition chair Howard Philips in 1992. The website also states that some of the parties believe are strong pro life, anti gun control, anti tax, anti immigration and trade protectionist. Another party mentioned by the website is the Green Party of the United States. The Green party is described as an affiliate of the environmentalist European Greens Movement. A big third party is the Libertarian Party which for many years has been led by the current Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul. The party was founded in 1971. The website politics1.com /parties describe them as centrist who believe in total individual and economic freedom. Many of the Libertarian views are shared by the Republican Party. So the big three third parties are the Constitution, Green and Libertarian Party. The next third parties that I will be describing are smaller ones.</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The America First Party (AFP) was founded in 2002. According to politics1.com /parties AFP<em>&ldquo;Vows to protect our people and our sovereignty&hellip;.promote economic growth and independence&hellip; encourage the traditional values of faith, family and responsibility&hellip;. Ensure equality before the law in protecting those rights granted by the creator and to clean up our corrupted political system&rdquo;</em>. The American Party is described by the website as a conservative, Christian party. They advocate for things like an end to farm price supports/subsidies, privatization of the US Postal Services, opposes federal involvement in education , supports abolition of the EPA, supports the repeal of NAFTA, believes that federal government has no place in education, opposes minimum wage, and land use zoning regulations. The American Independent Party (AIP) was founded by Governor George C Wallace and was a nominated by the party for President in 1968. Mr. Wallace ran on an anti Washington platform, anti racial integration and anti communist platform. Running on these topics Mr. Wallace was able to win nearly 1.1 million votes and 5 southern states. The America&rsquo;s Party (AP) was created by Alan Keyes. The party believes in pro life without exception, is anti gay rights, pro gun rights, believes in the concept of peace through strength, anti tax and opposes any programs that aren&rsquo;t clearly authorized by the constitution. The Boston Tea Party supports reducing the size, extent and authority of government at all levels and on all matters, and is in opposition of increasing the size, scope and power of government at any level, for any reason. The Communist Party USA (CPUSA) calls for free universal health care, elimination of the federal income tax on people earning less than $60,000 a year, free college education, big cuts in military spending, public works programs, elimination of corporate monopolies. CPUSA also wants the public ownership of energy and other basic industries as well as huge tax hikes for corporate and the wealthy.</p>
	<p>
		One of the most interesting third parties I have come across is the Modern Whig Party (MWP). In case your memory is short the historical Whig Party lasted from 1833 to 1856. The Modern Whig Party was launched in 2008. The party stands for fiscal accountability, strong national security and bold social development. The Working families Party (WFP) is an established third party. It was founded in 1998 by a coalition of labor unions. For many years it operated exclusively in NY but by 2006-08 the group had expanded to other states. WFP stands for the advancement of labor union in the political arena and has focused on liberal economy and employment issues. I mentioned these groups because it&rsquo;s important to be politically active. Unless the Democrat and Republican get more competition by a third party little will change; both parties have monopolized the political arena. The discontent towards both parties has reached such height that if a third party is able to motivate and mobilize the American people both parties would be in trouble.</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to an article on the Daily News Politics section <em>&ldquo;The Republican Party and Party seemed to be a natural political pairing. But what may have seemed like another politically beneficial alliance-Democrats and Occupy Wall Street-hasn&rsquo;t happened. Although both Democrats and Occupy protesters have similar views on economic inequality and corporate responsibility, each holds at each other arms length. &ldquo;</em>It would make sense to do so for the Occupy Movement as it might alienate participants that are fed up with the two party system. It could also limit the movement&rsquo;s ability to morph itself. James made a great point in his article in the online magazine <em>&ldquo;In These Times&rdquo;</em> in which he stated that <em>&ldquo;The question is: How can this movement be sustained? Part of the answer lies in the willingness of traditional progressive organizations-labor, environmental, women&rsquo;s, civil, human , gay and disability rights movements and faith based organizations to coalesce around it, to turn people out and to provide resources </em></p>
	<p>
		<em>&ldquo;.</em>The current approval rating for congressman is very low and there is general dissatisfaction with both parties so the Occupy movement is in a good position to garnish political support. In spite of having legitimate reasons to protest the movement risks being burned out by continuous protest without results. This becomes a realistic possibility because even though many agree with the movement there is still a significant amount of people that don&rsquo;t think anything will change. Most recently a group of people from the Occupy Wall Street movement have created the Demands Working Group which listed a list of solutions to help this country get on the right path. At the same time it has announced a national convention to be held in Philadelphia on July 4, 2012. According to Tyler Kinkade from the Huffington Post the plan includes electing delegates by direct vote.&nbsp; It will be one male and female per each of the 435 congressional districts. The 870 delegates would then create a list of grievances.</p>

		<strong><u>Part E: Leadership? What leadership?</u></strong></p>
	<p>
		Fault for failure to get this country moving in the right direction falls on both parties. A third party in congress could force both parties to get along. The whole situation with raising the debt ceiling and failure of the super committee magnifies the current toxic political climate. The Super Committee was creating as a compromise during the debt ceiling debate. The Super Committee was made up of six Democrats and six Republicans from both chambers. Their job was come up with a bill that cuts at least $ 1.5 trillion by Thanksgiving, entitlement programs and others will automatically be slashed. Considering that both parties were going to suffer cuts in some programs they deem &lsquo;sacred&rsquo; I was very optimistic. The debt ceiling debate was bad and it didn&rsquo;t project a good image of the United States to the outside word.&nbsp; Failure of the super Committee should not be taken lightly and it has become a national tragedy. This group of twelve members had a chance to do big things; something that politicians on both sides were afraid to do. We cannot and should not accept the concept that we can wait until the 11<sup>th</sup> hour to get things done. Heather Boushey who is a senior economist at the Center for American progress said it best when stating that the super committee had within its power the capacity to progress our economy. They could have taken steps to encourage growth and to support job creation which would, in turn, help improve our long term budget picture. The failure of the super committee highlights politician&rsquo;s inability to work together. The countries debt is going up and up and our credit rating has suffered. The clear solution to shrinking our debt is raising taxes, reducing spending and moderate budget cuts. However, when it comes to cutting budget along with raising taxes, poor and middle class should not carry the burden. It is not fair could stunt significant growth in the long run. What we are missing are politicians willing to make the hard decisions and ready to cross the traditional political stance to get things done. The time for political squabbles is not now and with all of the serious facing this nation congress has failed to show any urgency.</p>
	<p>
		Act of urgency on the part of Congress will not take place until you the people demand action. For now politicians are betting on complacency on the part of the American people. They are betting that we will sit home and watch the circus that is happening in Congress but we can no longer afford to be spectators. You have heard this before but we are at a crossroads. With China and other rising powers closing in on us we will either define the future or we can let others define it for us. If you don&rsquo;t care about what goes in than sit down and watch but remember that by the time you decide to force politicians to act like grown ups, compromise and do what is right for this country it might be to late. The stupidity and immaturity of this zero sum game in Washington must stop. It must because while they fight and squabble we the people who elected them to govern are drowning.&nbsp; The problems in this country are many what&rsquo;s missing are practical solutions and a comprehensive vision for America</p>

	<strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>
<p>
	Our economic state is in a depressive condition the middle class is being squeeze and the American dream which has helped us accomplish remarkable things is being threatened. I believe that in order to jumpstart the economy we need serious infrastructure spending. We must reform out tax system to lessen the burden on the poor and middle class. An effective tax system could divert sources to key sectors of our economy that leads to stable long term growth and innovation. Something must be done to slow the rising cost of higher education. If it continues at the current rate it will be out of touch for many Americans. The dwindling of our middle class poses a threat to the image we project to the world and our civic society. At the same time the rising rate of poverty, homelessness and lack of income mobility is making it harder for Americans to achieve the American dream.&nbsp; If we are still the country of opportunity than let&rsquo;s show it; let&rsquo;s show it by narrowing the income gap and supporting the middle class while creating economic opportunities for low income families. While government can not do everything it can provide the right environment for economic prosperity and other things that help its citizenry. We have a congress that has failed to lead. Rather than taking action they embarked on a zero sum tactic and political grandstanding. Ethics and efficiency of our government depends on civic participation.</p>

It&rsquo;s got war and betrayal, arson and espionage. It&rsquo;s literally on fire. We need you to help us play this out.</p>

	But here&rsquo;s the thing. The juicy plum is hidden away, under a crunchy rich crust of history. Yeah, history. It&rsquo;s only a few hundred &ndash; okay, a couple thousand words. Oh, and we&rsquo;ve hidden slices of it in various historic places, old documents, and artifacts. And you, the player, happen to be a 13-year-old eighth grader. It&rsquo;s not that you don&rsquo;t like to read, truly. It&rsquo;s just that, if given a choice, you&rsquo;d rather watch a video and text your friends &ndash; especially if the alternative has got anything to do with something that happened like a gazillion years ago and is being promoted by your teacher and librarian as a fun lab activity with visiting researchers. Think about it. You were born the same year as <em>Google</em> and Zelda&rsquo;s<em>Ocarina of Time</em>. By the time you finished second grade, the world had downloaded over half a billion songs from <em>iTunes</em>, bought 42 million iPods, and witnessed the launch of <em>YouTube</em>. I mean, really: you <em>just</em> crossed the minimum age threshold to legally hold a <em>Facebook</em> account. Why would you even think to check out a history-based website &ndash; at school, no less &ndash; that required you to plough through three or four paragraphs about Benjamin Franklin, even if your teachers said it could be cool? &hellip;Especially if your teachers said it could be cool.</p>

	But that&rsquo;s exactly what we had, just 19 days before the launch of the first installment of our Alternate Reality Game (ARG), the <em>Arcane Gallery of Gadgetry (AGOG)</em>: a carefully crafted counterfactual history about the events leading up to the US Civil War, as well as the key roles played by the US Patent Office and the inventions housed within it. It was mid-March, and <em>AGOG &ldquo;Season 1&rdquo;</em> was slated for play during the first two weeks of April, by approximately 60 eighth graders. In early March, <a href=""http://www.impressionableplayers.com/?page_id=105"">Ann Fraistat</a>, <em>AGOG&rsquo;s</em> creative writer (and soon-to-be in-game protagonist), had deftly stitched most of the game&rsquo;s fictional strands into the weft of what we know today about antebellum America. To the rest of the <em>AGOG</em> design team, Ann had created a narrative replete with what transmedia author, J.C. Hutchins calls the &ldquo;<em>thrill, intrigue, frighten trifecta</em>:&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a> our mythology featured a philanthropic society torn in two by an ideological rift among its members, mysterious, recurring conflagrations and artifacts gone missing, and historical figures communicating across space and time to prevent reversals of past events that could cause potentially catastrophic changes in current events. But &ndash; how exactly might we feed its crisis and complexity to a bunch of 13 and 14 year olds? Note that during these same two weeks, our teen players would also be charged with choosing and completing training missions in navigation, scientific invention, archives, or cryptography, in order to become members of the secret society whose history we needed to convey &ndash; and whose survival they needed to care about. Arrrrggh.</p>

	<em>AGOG</em>is part of a larger study on the design and use of educational ARGs, and you can learn more about <em>AGOG</em> <a href=""http://www.arcanegalleryofgadgetry.org/season-1/"">hither</a>, <a href=""http://www.arcanegalleryofgadgetry.org/"">thither</a>, and <a href=""http://www.playthepast.org/?p=1888"">yon</a>(that is, if you&rsquo;re not an eighth grader preoccupied with teenage topics). Here, our middle-state story centers on the creation of April G., the <em>AGOG</em> in-game protagonist who became the primary mechanism by which our eighth grade players ingested and interacted with game&rsquo;s narrative. The middle-state artifact that I think represents April&rsquo;s story best is Ann&rsquo;s sketch, captured in the spiral-bound notebook she used to record her research. In happy hindsight, based on in-class chat messages, lab observation, and a post-game survey, we can report that April was not only the primary means for meting out the storyline; she was an engaging and effective one. However, it wasn&rsquo;t quite so clear to us on the Ides of March.</p>

<p>
	One of the wonderful things about ARG design is that it mirrors ARG play: it hums along best when powered by &ldquo;<em>bunches of brains</em>.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a> So it was with <em>AGOG Season 1</em>. Any one of us might lob a question out to the group &ndash; mundane or mythic &ndash; and we&rsquo;d all brainstorm a bevy of ideas until we found what felt like the right response to that question. In the same way that players follow an ARG&rsquo;s narrative elements and collaborate across media, ARG designers brainstorm across multiple modes of communication.<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a> We shared ideas via email, texts, photographs, sketches, our design wiki, Google docs, Skype conversations, face-to-face meetings, and any number of mash-ups in-between.&nbsp; Would it be hyperbole for me to say that over the course of designing <em>AGOG</em> we had a veritable orgy of ideas, all arms and legs and heads and hearts thrown together in any number or form of rendezvous? Um, no. Admittedly, a scandalous image for the nineteenth century characters who were dragged into or borne out of our happy mess &ndash; but a fetching (and earnest) one, nonetheless.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	So that&rsquo;s what we did. We studied Ann&rsquo;s rich back-story that threatened to remain opaque to our teen players, and we brainstormed. Between March 14<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup>, on our design wiki and via emails, we weighed the pros and cons of presenting physical &ldquo;musty old tomes&rdquo; to the players, or graphic novel formats, or partially complete wiki entries, and of embedding more clues or videos into training missions. We looked at past ARGs (successful and not-so) and recalled how most of them feature in-game protagonists<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""">[4]</a> who discover their mythology in tandem with the players. JC Hutchins coined the phrase, &ldquo;<em>protagonist by proxy</em>&rdquo; to describe this interactive dynamic of ARGs, in which the player is presented with the same artifacts and information &ndash; such as URLs, copies of documents, photographs, email addresses, or phone numbers &ndash; as the in-game protagonist. Players have the chance to unearth secrets that the in-game character may not have but needs, and the in-game character has the means to communicate new information to the players. We had already conceived one present-day in-game character, Colette Gravure, the used bookstore owner who discovered one of the inventions from the <em>AGOG</em>, naively making public a centuries-old secret. Unfortunately, Colette was in her 60s &ndash; somewhere between the school librarian and Ben Franklin in terms of cool factor and age. But what if Colette had a niece or nephew who also stumbled upon the <em>AGOG</em> rabbit hole site? The new in-game protagonist should not be the same age as the middle school students, but definitely not &ldquo;too old.&rdquo;</p>

<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	Figure 3: April Gravure page on the AGOG design wiki</p>
<p>
	By March 19<sup>th</sup>, April Gravure &ndash; &ldquo;April G.&rdquo; to the players &ndash; was born. Her wiki page, describing her as &ldquo;<em>Collete Gravure&rsquo;s 21-year-old niece</em>,&rdquo; was posted and profile photos uploaded. On April 4<sup>th</sup>, a video of her taking the oath as a member of <em>JENIUS</em><a href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title="""">[5]</a>, an important <em>AGOG</em> secret society, was available to players, and by April 5<sup>th</sup>, over 50 of them had watched her first video blog to learn who she was and where to start. April G. also enabled us to iron out an end-game mechanism that we had puzzled over: how would we decide which player got to send the climactic message back in time? The players&rsquo; new end-game goal would be to ensure that April had all that was required for her to carry out the deed.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	If you examine Ann&rsquo;s notebook, you will find that there is only one reference to April G. &ndash; Ann&rsquo;s sketch (Figure 2). Ann also gave us copies of the notes she organized in a series of date-stamped Microsoft Word documents. In these notes, the first reference to April G. came on March 16<sup>th</sup> &ndash; and contained a half a page either derived from or relayed in our design emails that day:</p>
<p>
	<img alt=""Text Box: Protagonist by proxy:
-For the amount of mythology we need to impart, this seems like a good mechanism to me.
-Yes, I’m happy to act it, if you like. I also have an improv-trained background, so I’m comfortable interacting with players live if we want to do that via streaming, or even in person if that comes up.
-Can’t be Collette. To plausibly use Mildred Lewis Rutherford as a character, had to age Collette into her 60s. Could be her niece. I agree that the players would probably want someone closer to their own age, and to middle-schoolers, I think college seems like the height of coolness. How about a college student at UMD? If we wanted to, this would let us keep the same character when we adjust the game for college kids, too.
(Plus, there’s the added advantage of the fact that I probably pass for a college kid a little better than a high schooler… haha, at any rate, I hope… J)
-If this is what we’re doing, then maybe it makes sense this is the character who sends the 2011 message instead of a student? Easy way to justify her necessity to the plot.

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	That&rsquo;s it. It was as if April G. had blossomed from Ann&rsquo;s head like Athena burst forth from Zeus&rsquo;s. Perhaps the rest of us on the team functioned in part like Metis, helping to plant the seed, or like Hephaestus, helping to draw it out. Regardless, from these deceptively simple musings, Ann developed a very real, humorous, simpatico character with whom all our teen players connected. Most wanted to help her, coax clues out of her, or simply chat with her. As April, Ann delivered the key to unlocking the story for our young players. By April 15<sup>th</sup>, less than a month after April sprang to life, Ann had crafted and delivered seven <a href=""http://www.arcanegalleryofgadgetry.org/time_files/slide0003.htm"">incredible video installments</a>to the players, and had their undivided attention. I can safely conclude that years from now, when budding transmedia designers study the &ldquo;protagonist by proxy&rdquo; technique, April G. will be one of the illustrious theogyny of in-game characters required for review. Before that, however, <em>AGOG</em> <em>Season 2</em> is coming soon, and April G. is waiting.</p>

	Over the past few months, since the inception of the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement, we have consistently heard that they are a leaderless movement, whose motives and message is unclear, and because they are leaderless and without a &ldquo;clear&rdquo; set of demands, they are useless.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a>They have constantly been framed as &ldquo;dirty hippies,&rdquo; and degenerate low-life&rsquo;s, or as a bunch of confused and lazy kids who need to &ldquo;quit asking for handouts and get a job.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a>Much of this rhetoric distracts and confuses the messages that are apparent within the Occupy movement, which has almost become a global phenomenon, fighting for justice and equity.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This essay will explore the power and theory behind having a leaderless movement through an examination of Deleuze and Guattari&rsquo;s <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em> and a Foucaultian examination of power.I hope to show that by remaining leaderless and having no explicit demands, it makes the movement more fluid and thus more effective in disseminating its message. Furthermore, this essay will look at the ways that opponents to the Occupy movement have attempted to frame them in a way that makes them appear &ldquo;dangerous,&rdquo; and &ldquo;dirty,&rdquo; similar to the tactics used by the government in opposition to the anarchist movement a century ago. To do so, I will work again through Foucault, but also use Kathy Ferguson&rsquo;s <em>Discourses of Danger</em>. Therefore, these tactics of framing coupled with the organization that the OWS movement has adopted, create what Deleuze and Guattari would describe as a &ldquo;Becoming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<strong>The Rhizomatic Assemblage</strong></p>
<p align=""center"">
	&ldquo;<em>A rhizome may be broken, shattered, at a given spot, but it will start up again on one of its old lines, or on new lines.&rdquo;</em><a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a></p>
<p>
	For many it started as a couple thousand protestors marched upon Wall Street in New York City to protest corporate greed and Wall Street&rsquo;s influence upon politics.<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""">[4]</a> The protestors settled on building an encampment at Zuccotti Park in lower Manhattan to continue their protest for an undetermined amount of time. There were no particular unified demands, besides the implicit end of corporate greed; in essence it was a rejection of the system and an attempt to resist the tenants of neoliberal ideology. As the protests continued they started garnering more support and September 24<sup>th</sup> when police responded to the peaceful protest with violence, thus gaining national media attention, the movement sparked into a national movement as people came out in droves across the country to their state capitols and various institutions of power to fight the injustices perpetuated upon what the protestors were calling the 99%.<a href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title="""">[5]</a></p>
<p>
	This constantly shifting multiplicity spread rhizomatically as encampments started forming all over the nation. The more violence that was utilized by the state, the more attention it gained, which allowed it to grow exponentially. The composition of people was diverse as it was accepting of any race, creed, gender, culture, sexual orientation, etc. Even people who would be financially considered as part of the 1% were allowed to participate and be apart of the movement, from the rich and famous to people who inherited money, they all joined to fight a system that was constantly oppressive.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This conflict against corporate greed is more than just an ideological struggle, but can be seen as a battle of power. In Foucault&rsquo;s <em>Society Must Be Defended</em>, he posits two hypotheses of what power is: First, &ldquo;that which represses;&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"" title="""">[6]</a>Second, a &ldquo;clash between forces.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"" title="""">[7]</a>Thus, we find the power of the corporate elites on one side who utilize the state with their abundant funds, and on the other side there are the protestors who utilize their bodies, physical space, and their voice. Therefore we find a site of resistance that can be examined by looking at some of the tactics used against one another in this clash of forces.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tactics of 1%</strong></p>
<p>
	One of the primary tactics used by those who oppose the Occupy movement has been physical violence and suppression, which has back fired as it has created more sympathy for the occupy movement thus giving it more momentum, but what I wish to really examine is not the physical violence but rather the framing which has occurred in order to contain the messages that the Occupy movement are disseminating. The first, as mentioned in the intro, is the idea that they are dirty. This has become the impetus of cause for the removal of the encampments, claiming that they create a &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; public health risk.<a href=""#_ftn8"" name=""_ftnref8"" title="""">[8]</a>While living in close quarters in an inclement climate carries certain risks, the OWS movement made numerous strides to combat the spread of disease, including but not limited to: Having medical tents, sometimes staffed by professional doctors and nurses; Sanitation teams, in charge of cleaning around the camp, and; Distributing sanitation supplies.<a href=""#_ftn9"" name=""_ftnref9"" title="""">[9]</a>I could find no reports of major illnesses being spread throughout any of the camps, which may show that it was well enough regulated to curb the worries of those who claimed that the movement presented a health risk. Furthermore, this shows that it has become more of a tool of suppression than a tool of preserving public health, because if the mayor&rsquo;s truly cared about public health then they would spend their resources on helping ensure that the movement was able to access healthcare that allowed them to continue to voice their first amendment right. Instead, they allocated their money in monitoring, controlling, and removing the Occupy movement with police, which was probably more costly than the prior.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second way in which the Occupy movement has been labeled as &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; has been in its association with anarchism, and while there are anarchists within the movement, and many anarchist tactics are being utilized, it is a very diverse movement which perpetuates no political affiliation.<a href=""#_ftn10"" name=""_ftnref10"" title="""">[10]</a>This labeling has primarily been done in order to align it with the common misconceptions of anarchism, which is that of chaos and violence. This rhetoric is aimed at being a form of justification for the violence against the OWS movement in order to draw sympathy from those who have yet to decide what they think about it, and to create rhetorical ammo for those whom oppose it already. The voices they aim to suppress could be articulated as what Ferguson and Foucault classify as <em>parrhesia, </em>or in other words, radical truth tellers. In Kathy Ferguson&rsquo;s <em>Emma Goldman: Political Thinking in the Streets</em>, she states, &ldquo;Dangerous individuals and <em>parrhesia</em> are logical mirrors of one another, linked positions within discursive networks of power and resistance.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn11"" name=""_ftnref11"" title="""">[11]</a>Therefore, we see Foucault&rsquo;s site of power conflict come to the forefront within the ways in which the Occupy movement was framed.</p>
<p>
	<strong>99 Sites of Resistance %</strong></p>
<p align=""center"">
	&ldquo;<em>Power and resistance confront each other, and use multiple, mobile, and changing tactics&hellip; as the strategic and warlike logic of struggle.&rdquo;</em><a href=""#_ftn12"" name=""_ftnref12"" title="""">[12]</a></p>
<p>
	The OWS movement has deployed a number of different tactics, most all nonviolent, but more importantly engaged in creating discourses of truth. Much like Foucault&rsquo;s analysis of genealogy, the OWS movement&rsquo;s creation of these discourses of truth entail &ldquo;an analysis of descent&hellip; situated within the articulation of the body and history. [Whose] task is to expose a body totally imprinted by history and the process of history&rsquo;s destruction of the body.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn13"" name=""_ftnref13"" title="""">[13]</a>This has been accomplished in a number of ways, but the most visible has been through a website which highlights photos taken by people who are primarily holding up a sign telling their stories.<a href=""#_ftn14"" name=""_ftnref14"" title="""">[14]</a>Many of the stories tell of the ways in which they have been physically affected by neoliberal policies, from lack of ability to afford healthcare to injuries of war. Their stories usually explain how they got to where they are now, thus creating a history, which makes their bodies products of violence.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another way in which the OWS movement has created resistance to those who oppose it is by not conforming to standard forms of resistance, i.e. being a leaderless movement and not generating a specific list of demands. By not creating these demands they are therefore refusing to recognize the legitimacy of the state.<a href=""#_ftn15"" name=""_ftnref15"" title="""">[15]</a>This in turn creates a space in which all their actions no matter how big or small become forms of resistance in and of themselves, thus generating more recognizable power. On the matter of being a leaderless movement, they have instead adopted the process of consensus, which is a more pure form of direct democracy. It ensures that everyone within the process has a say, and the process will not continue and not move forward until all are satisfied. This produces a &ldquo;block of becoming.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn16"" name=""_ftnref16"" title="""">[16]</a></p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion: Becoming-Revolution</strong></p>
<p align=""center"">
	<em>&ldquo;If becoming is a block, it is because it constitutes a zone of proximity and indiscernibility, a no-man&rsquo;s-land, a nonlocalizable relation sweeping up the two distant or contiguous points, carrying one into the proximity of the other.&rdquo;</em><a href=""#_ftn17"" name=""_ftnref17"" title="""">[17]</a></p>
<p>
	The above quote exemplifies the power of a leaderless movement in that by being one person, the leader, you are merely a single point, but as a block, or as a group of points, all are leaders, all are stronger. Deleuze and Guattari describe a becoming as a shift into a multiplicity, or a pack. Their conception highlights that there is an exceptional individual, which defines and shapes the pack. In this situation it is not so much an individual person, but rather different sites of struggle. From the original Occupy site in NYC to the heated battles in Oakland, these sites have become the definitions and representations of the Occupy movement, there is no hierarchy and it is constantly shifting and changing making it the perfect example of a body without organs. Fore there is no heart, no lungs, no brain, no liver, no spleen, no eyes, no stomach, no nose, and no skin&hellip; no nothing; just a multiplicity of points, forming bocks, connected by lines, becoming&hellip; revolution.</p>

	<strong>Democracy: A Work in Progress</strong></p>
<p>
	In 2011 we witnessed two extraordinary international people&rsquo;s movements: the Arab Spring and the Occupy movement. The Occupy movement followed the Arab Spring, and seemed to draw inspiration from it, to feel a certain affinity with it. The first day of the Occupation at St. Paul&rsquo;s, someone put up a mock London street sign with &lsquo;Tahrir Square&rsquo; written on it, expressing solidarity with protestors in Egypt.</p>
<p>
	But in what respect do these two movements resemble each other in their aims? To what extent can the Arab Spring and the Occupy movement be seen as <em>trying to do the same thing</em>?</p>
<p>
	The aims of the Arab Spring are clear: they want elections. The Arab Spring began in countries where leaders maintain power with force rather than votes, with protestors demanding the right to choose their own government.</p>
<p>
	The aims of the Occupy movement are less straightforward. It is clear what occupy is <em>against</em>: the movement is born out of a deep concern with global capitalism, at least in its present form. But what is the movement <em>for</em>? I participated in an early attempt at the St. Paul&rsquo;s Occupation to draw up demands. It wasn&rsquo;t easy. Some suggested demanding a tax on financial transactions; others objected that they didn&rsquo;t believe in finance. Some suggested global government; others the abolishing of government altogether. With such a diversity of convictions and concerns, consensus proved elusive.</p>
<p>
	However, there is one thing which in my experience all those involved in the Occupation sign up to, and that is <em>democracy</em>. If there is to be one positive goal which unities the Occupy movement, it must be the desire to bring about true democracy: rule by the people rather than the powerful.</p>
<p align=""center"">
	<strong>Counter-democratic forces</strong></p>
<p>
	This might seem strange. Isn&rsquo;t the Occupy movement taking place in countries which already have democracy? In UK and USA, you can go in a little booth every five years and tick the person you want to have power. Isn&rsquo;t that democracy?</p>
<p>
	Well yes and no. It would be over cynical to suggest that universal suffrage is not a significant achievement in the journey towards ideal democracy, and perhaps unfair to those who fought hard to get it. But it would be na&iuml;ve to think that the political system we have is anything more than a work in progress towards genuine democracy. There are significant counter-democratic forces operating, to a greater and lesser extent, in all &lsquo;democratic&rsquo; countries, which ensure that the powerful have undue influence in how society is shaped.</p>
<p>
	We can divide these non-democratic forces into two categories: <em>intra-national</em> and <em>trans-national</em>. The intra-national counter-democratic forces include corporate lobbying, funding of political parties by big business and the wealthy, and the selective information given out by major newspapers in the pursuit of their own political agenda. Democracy is about society being shaped by the people, where each person counts equally. But in all these ways the powerful few manage to have a weighty influence on governance.</p>
<p>
	But perhaps even more significant are the trans-national counter-democratic forces, and it is here that the aim of enhancing democracy connects with the Occupy movement&rsquo;s concerns regarding global capitalism. The defining contemporary problem is that (imperfect) democracy operates at a national level, whilst global capitalism operates at a global level. The power of an elected government to run the country as it pleases is severely constrained by the power of markets. Perhaps the most straightforward example of this is in the setting of tax rates. Countries are continually held to ransom by trans-national corporations threatening to leave should their tax obligations be increased. What is an appropriate level of corporate contribution to the public good should be decided by the people. Instead, to a large degree it is decided by trans-national corporations.</p>
<p align=""center"">
	<strong>How can we achieve democracy?</strong></p>
<p>
	In a sense then, we can see the Arab Spring and the Occupy movement as having the same goal: true democracy. Whilst the Arab Spring aims is trying to achieve the beginnings of democracy at a <em>national level</em> (by attaining free and fair elections), the Occupy movement is trying to perfect democracy within countries, and to attain it at a <em>global level</em>.</p>
<p>
	Despite this commonality of goal, there is an important difference in the two cases. It is (more or less) clear what the countries of the Arab Spring are seeking to achieve their goals; what they want (free and fair elections) already exists (more or less) in other countries. But the aims of Occupy lead us into uncharted territories. How can we counter the power wielded by the wealthy through political party funding and lobbying? How are we to protect the sources of truth from the pernicious distortions of certain elements of the media? Forming credible solutions to these difficulties requires thought, research, discussion, co-operation. These are the very things the Occupy movement is good at, but it&rsquo;s not an easy task.</p>
<p>
	Working out the way forward regarding global capitalism is even more challenging. If the essence of the difficulty is that (imperfect) democracy exists at a national level, whilst global capitalism operates at a global level, there seem logically to be two ways to right this wrong: we can either pull capitalism down from a global to a national level (or get rid of it altogether), or we can pull democracy up from a national to a global level. My preference, at least in the first instance, is the latter approach, which I will now spell out in more detail.</p>
<p align=""center"">
	<strong>Fiscal solidarity</strong></p>
<p>
	Global democracy need not entail global government, but perhaps a kind of &lsquo;fiscal solidarity&rsquo; between democratic communities. Marx taught us to conceive of the class war as between workers and capitalists. But we might think of the contemporary class war as between democratic communities and global capital. The &lsquo;collective dictator&rsquo; of global capitalism sustains power by pitting democratic communities against each other. As individual nations compete by lowering tax rates and cutting regulation in order to attract capital, more and more wealth is transferred from the 99% to the 1%.</p>
<p>
	Marx taught us that workers need to organise to break their chains. Similarly, democratic communities have everything to gain if they organise. If we co-operate rather than compete, we can slay the dragon of tax competition by ensuring that global capital has nowhere to run to (which may ultimately involve refusing to trade with &lsquo;scab&rsquo; nations). If the citizens of the world could choose how to tax big business, finance and the wealthy, free from the need to be &lsquo;competitive&rsquo;, then we might finally begin to redistribute wealth back from the 1% to the 99%. The days of not having enough to provide the highest standards of health, education and public services to all would be confined to history. Furthermore, equality at a global level could be regulated, by allowing developing countries the tax advantages currently afforded to Switzerland and the Cayman Islands.</p>
<p>
	At the present time, this level of global co-operation seems not to be a realistic option, not least because national democracy is in each country either imperfect or non-existent. But what I have sketched above is an ideal, which could be worked towards in stages. The establishment of a Robin Hood Tax on financial transactions would be an important first step. Once people see how much they have to gain from getting a grip on global capitalism, they may be inspired to go further.</p>
<p>
	This is an ideological battle. Nobody talks about &lsquo;trickle down&rsquo; any more. The new myth to persuade the 99% to act and vote against their interests is the fear of &lsquo;big government&rsquo;. What the economic right don&rsquo;t tell you is that freedom for capital and freedom for the people are diametrically opposed.</p>
<p align=""center"">
	<strong>The next stage</strong></p>
<p>
	The Occupy movement should see it self as a movement for democracy which aims at enhancing democracy within democratic communities, and reclaiming for democratic communities the power lost to global capitalism. How this is to be done is far from obvious. I have given outlined above one proposal, and encourage others to do the same. It&rsquo;s not going to be easy, but if the Occupy movement is to continue to grow as an effective force for political change, it must begin the hard job of working out the details of how to bring about true democracy.</p>

	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Hannah Arendt takes great care to carefully redefine a number of terms that she claims are commonly misused in the common parlance. Among these, &lsquo;action&rsquo; and &lsquo;power&rsquo; stand out to me as both the most gripping and the most relevant today. Arendt&rsquo;s definition of these two terms, therefore, will be the first point of discussion. In this section I will also clarify the meaning of &lsquo;public space&rsquo; and &lsquo;appearance&rsquo; as they are fundamental to the discussion of action and power. Then, I will take these terms and examine how their respective concepts appear in recent events, the 2011 Egyptian Revolution and the Occupy Movement being the chief focus among them. My aim is twofold: to give an accessible example to help better understand Arendt, and to evaluate these events to see if they exemplify Arendt&rsquo;s theories on action and power.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong><em><u>Arendtian Terminology</u></em></strong></p>
<p>
	<em><u>Action</u></em></p>
<p>
	<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General Criteria</em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arendt heavily emphasizes the notion of action, and invests in it so much power and import as to make the ability to act essentially equate to the ability to do anything. History itself, she writes, is &ldquo;a story of action and deeds rather than of trends and forces or ideas.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a> There are multiple facets to Arendt&rsquo;s idea of action, first of which is that &ldquo;action is irreversible, and a return to the status quo in case of a defeat is always unlikely.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a> In short, Arendt is saying that any action will immediately result in some change and thus the world after the action &ndash; however small &ndash; is necessarily different from the world before it. Moreover, the flow of action will never end. Each action impacts another person, who is also able to act and therefore elicit reactions which are new actions in and of themselves; and so the cycle continues in a manner Arendt aptly describes as &ldquo;boundless.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a></p>
<p>
	Third, actions focus on the &ldquo;&rsquo;<em>inter</em>-ests&rsquo; in between and shared by men;&rdquo; thus, serving as the impetus for their gathering, the shared concerns of a group of people form the basis for action.<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""">[4]</a> Further discussion on the importance of gathering will take place below in the section of public space.</p>
<p>
	Fourth, actions require at least two parties or sides, &ldquo;the actor and the sufferer.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title="""">[5]</a> While for Arendt this is a short comment used merely as clarification, I see more in it. For one, it reemphasizes the concept that actions cannot be undertaken alone. Furthermore, it adds the requirement that an action must have someone on the other end, and cannot simply be for some isolated creation &ndash; football and not golf, competitive debate and not Toastmasters.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, action is unpredictable.<a href=""#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"" title="""">[6]</a> Unpredictability is the &ldquo;decisive character of human affairs.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"" title="""">[7]</a> This unpredictability centers on the rapid flux of moods and events that are the trademark of all human efforts, and especially of those involving collective action. Arendt explains that action doesn&rsquo;t bolster the world, it changes it even without &ldquo;plan or paradigm&rdquo; towards most of said changes. <a href=""#_ftn8"" name=""_ftnref8"" title="""">[8]</a> Most of this stems, she argues, from the fact that chains of actions and events can and do become automatic and atomistic, outside of man&rsquo;s foresight and control.<a href=""#_ftn9"" name=""_ftnref9"" title="""">[9]</a></p>
<p>
	This unpredictability leads to two further characteristics. Because the end result of an action &ldquo;can never be reliably predicted&rdquo; and is often frustrated before it runs its course, the means used to achieve goals (i.e. gathering, non-violence, specifics of data and tact, etc.) &ldquo;are more often than not of greater relevance to the future world than the intended goals.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn10"" name=""_ftnref10"" title="""">[10]</a> Additionally, because action will be unpredictable and its course will change, it &ldquo;must be free from motive on one side, <em>from its intended goal as a predictable effect on the other.</em>&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn11"" name=""_ftnref11"" title="""">[11]</a> In all, &ldquo;every act &hellip; is a &lsquo;miracle&rsquo; that is, something which could not be expected.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn12"" name=""_ftnref12"" title="""">[12]</a></p>
<p>
	Sixth, action is counter-normal.<a href=""#_ftn13"" name=""_ftnref13"" title="""">[13]</a>&nbsp; Arendt writes, &ldquo;we seek to instill nomos and thus preclude action in all society.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn14"" name=""_ftnref14"" title="""">[14]</a> I argue that in this statement is an implicit characterization of action as something that is adversarial to the &ldquo;normality&rdquo; of society. Given that nomos precludes action, action must then clash with nomos in order to come into being and, subsequently, fruition; therefore, action is a counter-normal force.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<em>Speech </em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speech, for Arendt, is irreversibly interconnected with action.<a href=""#_ftn15"" name=""_ftnref15"" title="""">[15]</a> For one, speaking the &ldquo;right words at the right time&rdquo; is an action in itself.<a href=""#_ftn16"" name=""_ftnref16"" title="""">[16]</a> Furthermore, &ldquo;without the accompaniment of speech&rdquo; action would not only &ldquo;lose its revolutionary character&rdquo;, but also it &ldquo;would lose its subject,&rdquo; because without speech, those involved would no longer be &lsquo;acting men&rsquo; but would instead be &lsquo;performing robots.&rsquo;<a href=""#_ftn17"" name=""_ftnref17"" title="""">[17]</a> Changing the focus from the actor to the action still leaves the same necessity for speech; if an action loses its speech making character for whatever reason, or even if the speech only retrogrades to &lsquo;mere talk,&rsquo; then the action becomes only &ldquo;productive activity.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn18"" name=""_ftnref18"" title="""">[18]</a> Action and speech are bound together, and together are &ldquo;part of living flux of acting and speaking.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn19"" name=""_ftnref19"" title="""">[19]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speech gains its importance because it serves as the necessary and sufficient condition for separating action from other forms of doing. If violence is exchanged for speech, or if speech is simply absent, that activity no longer qualifies as an action, in Arendt&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<em>Public Space and Appearance</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">
	According to Arendt, politics is fundamentally about the relationship of human beings with one another, the nature of their bond, the principles that unite them, and the very frame of the multiple local and temporary projects they undertake together.<a href=""#_ftn20"" name=""_ftnref20"" title="""">[20]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public space is the setting for action, which itself appears and then fades within that space. This space of appearance &ldquo;comes into being wherever men are together in the manner of speech and action.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn21"" name=""_ftnref21"" title="""">[21]</a> Furthermore, it is only in this public space that action can exist since action is &ldquo;never possible in isolation; to be isolated is to be deprived of the capacity to act.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn22"" name=""_ftnref22"" title="""">[22]</a> This is illustrated in part by the fact that abuse regimes seek to prevent gatherings because their monopoly on power is only truly threatened by such gatherings and their actions. Much of why this is the case is because within action, the strength of the individual gives way to collective force and is amplified by the same. Not only is power a factor, but the deep (if temporary) bonds within the group create a major threat to ruling power and a primary catalyst for successful action.<a href=""#_ftn23"" name=""_ftnref23"" title="""">[23]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public activity in the form of speech and action is of supreme importance to mankind; &ldquo;life without speech and without action &hellip; has ceased to be a human life because it is no longer lived among men.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn24"" name=""_ftnref24"" title="""">[24]</a> We are inherently social beings, and &ldquo;action not only has the most intimate relationship to the public part of the world common to us all, but is the one activity which constitutes it.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn25"" name=""_ftnref25"" title="""">[25]</a> Because of our social humanity and the importance of human reason, public gathering and the speech within it develop into ends in and of themselves; together, they become &ldquo;publicity for its own sake.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn26"" name=""_ftnref26"" title="""">[26]</a> Finally, it is important that all actors interact with one another, and not for or against any particular person or group of persons.<a href=""#_ftn27"" name=""_ftnref27"" title="""">[27]</a> In other words, I am there for the cause and as a cause we act; I am not a person helping other people or attacking some group. It is worth noting that while this may seem contradictory to the earlier requirement of an actor and a sufferer, it is not because the actor is merely such within the group, and the sufferer in the regime or policy needing changing rather than the people behind it.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being together while exercising speech and reason amplifies individual power and creates deep bonds, which together create the action and make it effective. Moreover, a noteworthy component that serves a catalyst towards bonds among the actors and a dedication to the action is the imminent threat of death. Faced together, during action, death does not instill fear, according to Arendt, but instead &lsquo;gives vitality.&rsquo;<a href=""#_ftn28"" name=""_ftnref28"" title="""">[28]</a> Her argument is that in the moment when death looms large during action, each man will automatically evaluate themselves and the situation and decide that the cause and thus the better future for the species is worth much more than the individual, and thereafter will be revitalized with ardor for the action. A more accessible way to understand the point might be to consider Les Mis&eacute;rables and its cry of &lsquo;to the barricades!&rsquo; or, better yet, Gregory from <em>Southpark: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, </em>and his mantra of &lsquo;La Resistance lives on!&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn29"" name=""_ftnref29"" title="""">[29]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, public action becomes natural when we as people take &ldquo;vicarious responsibility for things we have not done&rdquo;and &ldquo;consequences for things we are entirely innocent of&rdquo; because &ldquo;we live our lives not by ourselves but among our fellow man.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn30"" name=""_ftnref30"" title="""">[30]</a> Thus, as we see wrongdoing and suffering, we seek to set it right regardless of whether or not we played party to the abuse or even received it. This empathy, and the resulting action - the &ldquo;political faculty par excellence&rdquo; &ndash;&nbsp; can be &ldquo;actualized only in one of the many and manifold forms of the human community.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn31"" name=""_ftnref31"" title="""">[31]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Beginning, Middle, End, and Meaning</em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her section on Action in <em>The Human Condition</em>, Arendt breaks action, the term itself, into the beginning (<em>arche</em>) and the staying power, or lifespan, of the action (pratain).<a href=""#_ftn32"" name=""_ftnref32"" title="""">[32]</a> She continues that meanings have shifted towards a command, and the carrying out of that command; this is the obfuscation that she seeks to rollback. As such, the first part of an action is its principle, or inspiration, which is the base impetus for the action but is not unique to it and thus can be repeatedly used as a principle.<a href=""#_ftn33"" name=""_ftnref33"" title="""">[33]</a> Principle should not be conflated with motive. Motive is what leads people to be willing to participate; principle is what spurns the action itself. Next, and somewhat coincidently, action has its beginning, which is the key instance.<a href=""#_ftn34"" name=""_ftnref34"" title="""">[34]</a> In fact, to act in and of itself, according to Arendt, generally &ldquo;means to take an initiative, to begin.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn35"" name=""_ftnref35"" title="""">[35]</a> This beginning is something new that &ldquo;whatever may have happened before&rdquo; cannot predict, and which &ldquo;always happens against the overwhelming odds of statistical laws and their probability;&rdquo; therefore, the new always appears in the guise of a miracle.<a href=""#_ftn36"" name=""_ftnref36"" title="""">[36]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The course of the action is intuitive enough; it starts with the beginning and ends at the ending. The ending has its own importance, which is discussed more fully in the section on power; however, the simplest idea is that the action ends before and differently than does power or the public space. This is not all &ndash; the epilogue, too, serves its purpose in that the full meaning of an action can only be known after it is over and its chain stops or become long and complex enough that the given event is long obscured.<a href=""#_ftn37"" name=""_ftnref37"" title="""">[37]</a> Towards this point Arendt discusses the Greek concept of eudaimon and draws parallels between the idea of only being able to judge the goodness of a life after its end and only being able to fully judge an action after is ripples have calmed.<a href=""#_ftn38"" name=""_ftnref38"" title="""">[38]</a> Beyond this, I also note the same argument in her later point that action cannot be undone and the flow of action cannot be controlled or predicted, and again with the point that actions keep inspiring new action and thus grow and change unimaginably.<a href=""#_ftn39"" name=""_ftnref39"" title="""">[39]</a></p>
<p>
	<em><u>Power</u></em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Power is &ldquo;the lifeblood of the human artifice&rdquo; without which human affairs would be &ldquo;futile and vain.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn40"" name=""_ftnref40"" title="""">[40]</a> Power springs up whenever people get together and act in concert, but it derives its legitimacy from the initial getting together rather than from any action that may follow.<a href=""#_ftn41"" name=""_ftnref41"" title="""">[41]</a> That said, power &ldquo;does not survive the actuality of the movement which brought it into being.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn42"" name=""_ftnref42"" title="""">[42]</a> Thus, it &ldquo;springs up when men act together and vanishes the moment they disperse.<a href=""#_ftn43"" name=""_ftnref43"" title="""">[43]</a> Even so, power does survive the action and lives alone in the gap between the end of action and the dispersion of the gathering, during which time it can at any moment be reapplied to a new action. Power ends at dispersal because the group then loses then the capacity to act in concert because they are no longer bound together and readily accessible to one another.&nbsp; Finally, power must wane for it to then arise anew; it must be allowed to flux and vacillate.<a href=""#_ftn44"" name=""_ftnref44"" title="""">[44]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Power is a potential thing, and is not an unchangeable, measurable, and reliable entity like strength, for instance, might be.<a href=""#_ftn45"" name=""_ftnref45"" title="""">[45]</a> The characterization of power as a potential means a number of things. For one, power cannot be stored. It only exists as it is actualized, and then it fades.<a href=""#_ftn46"" name=""_ftnref46"" title="""">[46]</a> That said, power, unlike action, is guaranteed when people gather because the gathering ferments the power.<a href=""#_ftn47"" name=""_ftnref47"" title="""">[47]</a> A large part of this guarantee is backed by the fact that &ldquo;power is to an astonishing degree independent of material factors, either of numbers or means&rdquo; &ndash; if you gather, it will come.<a href=""#_ftn48"" name=""_ftnref48"" title="""">[48]</a> Furthermore, attempts to break the action, or redirect it, merely channel and inspire it as though it were a beast possessed and enraged.<a href=""#_ftn49"" name=""_ftnref49"" title="""">[49]</a> Under what conditions, then, is power actualized?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	Only where word and deed have not parted company, where words are not empty and deeds not brutal, where words are not used to veil intentions but to disclose realities, and deeds are not used to violate and destroy but to establish relations and create new realities.<a href=""#_ftn50"" name=""_ftnref50"" title="""">[50]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To crystallize the idea at hand, consider the relationship between Harry Potter and Voldemort. Much like the gathering generates power, Voldemort made Harry what he is and imparted upon him power he would not have otherwise had. Then, much like the power remains only so long as the gathering does, so too are Harry and Voldemort linked. Finally, once Voldemort is no more, Harry looses much of his definition but survives to fight another day if needed, just as power is residual after an action. Granted, if one were to delve deeply into J.K. Rowling&rsquo;s mythos, then this analogy would grow weaker. At face, however, it should provide clarification and a memory aid.</p>

	Popular revolt against materially strong rulers, on the other hand, may engender an almost irresistible power even if it foregoes the use of violence in the face of materially vastly superior forces&hellip; it is the most active and efficient ways of action ever devised, because it cannot be countered by fighting, where there may be defeat or victory, but only a mass slaughter in which even the victor is defeated, cheated of his prize, since nobody can rule over dead men.<a href=""#_ftn51"" name=""_ftnref51"" title="""">[51]</a></p>

<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arendt wrote around a half century ago, but that does not mean her theories and observations are relics of days long past. Action and power are irreversibly seated in mankind&rsquo;s toolbox; as long as man as we know it exists, so do the capacities for action and, therein, power.<a href=""#_ftn52"" name=""_ftnref52"" title="""">[52]</a> In fact, as we live our mundane lives in our communities, there is a latent sense of action and subtle pulse of power that need only be accessed. <a href=""#_ftn53"" name=""_ftnref53"" title="""">[53]</a></p>

<p>
	<em><u>2011 Egyptian Revolution </u></em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25 January 2011 earned the title of the &ldquo;Day of Revolt&rdquo; when active protests began to erupt throughout Egypt. On 8 February 2011, the Tahrir Square protests were in full swing. Patchen Markell called the Tahrir Square protests an Arendtian moment ripe with action and power marked by an upheaval for change, a fight against oppressive leadership.<a href=""#_ftn58"" name=""_ftnref58"" title="""">[58]</a> As I go through the characteristics of action and power, each will appear within the Tahrir Square protests; however, I will still argue that Professor Markell has made a small error in saying Tahrir Square was an Arenditan moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first check is whether this event was, in fact, irreversible. In fact, it was. The society, and especially the government, of Egypt has been forever changed. So too is (though to a lesser extent) the world as a whole, in that there is now more weight to the renaissance of effective protest that started in Tunisia and Syria, along with a chain of other uprisings that have sprung up very recently and very close to one another around the world.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second check is whether or not the flow of action will end. If past revolutionary protests &ndash; from the Boston Tea Party to Tiananmen Square &ndash;&nbsp; are an indicator, then it is safe to assume that the changes made by the protests in Eqypt, especially Tahrir Square, will continue to make changes and inspire still further changes, for as long as there is record and discussion of it.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third check is whether or not the action focused on shared interest. This ties in well with the discussion of acting for freedom. In this instance, the protest did indeed seek freedom, and that is nothing if not the shared interest of all those gathered, and likely most of the rest of the Egyptian people as well.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth check is to ensure that there were indeed two sides, the actor and sufferer, which is clearly the case. Furthermore, within the actors it would seem that all were acting together, not for one another, and against the regime and its laws, not the humans within. Therefore the teams, if you will, are properly arrayed and opposed.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fifth check is if the action was unpredictable. This event has unpredictability in spades. At the start, the intent of Egyptian protest was merely to seek address of certain abuses and to open the door for discussion of rectification. That said, what came of it was much, much more dramatic. That this would result in a full overthrow was indeed never predicted until the very moment it occurred. This also shows that the action, indeed, &ldquo;must be free from motive on one side, from its intended foal as a predictable effect on the other.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn59"" name=""_ftnref59"" title="""">[59]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sixth check is whether or not the goal, and then result, was counter-normal. Given that the Egyptian goal was a change in policy and practice, and as such was countering the usual and normal, this event meets the requirement of counter-normalness.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond these particular details, the protest has all of the parts of being Arenditan. There was the public space in which people gathered, generated power, took action and in so doing exercised their power, and then dispersed. There was a beginning, middle, and an end, though the meaning remains to be seen.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<em><u>The Occupy Movement</u></em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the Egyptian Revolution the Occupy Movement is is <em>generally </em>Arendtian, but is also definitely the truest instances of an Arendtian even in recent American history. Again, I will systemically perform checks on whether or not Occupy can qualify as an Arendtian event. Then I will give brief comment on why this might prove important.</p>
<p>
	The first check is whether this event was, in fact, irreversible. One&rsquo;s first instinct is to say that it is not. Like in Egypt, public display has changed how the people and government view certain institutions and the importance they each put on the talking points emphasized by occupy. Moreover, the world too is showing signs of sympathetic changes due to a combination of global Occupy demonstrations and growing administrative concerns over what such demonstrations could lately entail. That said, however, one could also argue that Occupy can be reversed. Admittedly it would take a long time and key allowances on the part of the people, but since occupy focuses most on social change its effects are thusly as fluid as are the people it affects and so could be neutralized.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second check is whether the flow of action will end. This, I argue, is an easy &lsquo;no.&rsquo; Even in the world wherein the specific effects of occupy have been neutralized (as mentioned above), the ideals of public display and civil disobedience reinvigorated by Occupy will indeed continue indefinitely. It seems clear that similar actions will harken back to Occupy for many years, as we do the Boston Tea Party and the Barricades of the French Revolution. As an occupier I interviewed said &ldquo;we are another step in a long legacy of actions like this, but given the where and when of our efforts we will be the movement getting the attention for many years to come; at least as long as I&rsquo;m alive.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn60"" name=""_ftnref60"" title="""">[60]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third check is whether the action focused on shared interest. This ties in well with the acting for equality, accountability, and balance championed by Occupy. In this instance, the protest did indeed seek positive change, and that is nothing if not the shared interest of all those gathered, and likely most of the rest of the 99% as well.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth check is to ensure that there were indeed two sides, the actor and sufferer, which is clearly the case; the Occupiers are the actors and the relevant financial industry and governmental figures would be the sufferers. It is even clearer with Occupy then Egypt that there are policies independent of acting persons (if upheld by them); thus, it is even more closely in keeping with Arendt&rsquo;s pictured form of event.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fifth check is if the action was unpredictable. This is likely the point at which occupy is most distant from Arendt&rsquo;s theory. Granted, there were likely people &ndash;even relevant agents &ndash; who were ignorant or blind to the impending change (Eichmann&rsquo;s in their own if less extreme right). However, in general, those policies and circumstances that spurned the outbreak of Occupy were clear and commonly seen harbingers. To return to the occupier, &ldquo;come on! These things were issues for our parents, and probably their parents. There have been mass media reports covering this [stuff] for years. How could anyone have been surprised?&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn61"" name=""_ftnref61"" title="""">[61]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sixth check is whether or not the goal, and then result, was counter-normal. Given that the Occupy goal is a change in fiscal and governmental policy and practice, and as such was countering the usual and normal, this event meets the requirement of counter-normalness. That said, it remains to be seen how much the full result of Occupy will meet this requirement, if at all.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond these particular details, the protest has most of the other parts of being Arenditan. There was the public space in which people gathered, generated power, took action, and in so doing, exercised their power. There was a beginning, and middle. Now, we wait for the final dispersal and thereby an end, and with a performative confirmation of the meaning of Occupy</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong><em><u>Conclusion &ndash; Power Eternal</u></em></strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As mentioned, I agree with Patchen that the Egyptian events &ndash; especially those in Tahrir &ndash; reek of Arendtian theory so much so that I would be comfortable calling them exemplar of its tenets. Furthermore, it is clear that the action proper is over, and it seems then that the people have dispersed and the power faded. However, while the action is over and the people are no longer crowding the streets, it is errant to say that the people are in diaspora and their power is gone. Arendt argues that&nbsp; &ldquo;only where men live so close together that the potentialities of action are always present can power remain with them;&rdquo; this is the world in which we now live.<a href=""#_ftn62"" name=""_ftnref62"" title="""">[62]</a> I do not mean this as a comment on urban overpopulation, but instead as a reflection on modern technology.</p>
<p>
	The Egyptian Revolution has also been called the &lsquo;Twitter Revolution&rsquo; because of the huge effect on coordination and efficacy that communication through Twitter and similar social media allowed. These social media and networking tools are always on, always at hand, and have near-instant information transfer. Furthermore, because of them, people are always in a public space unless they expend huge and practiced effort to avoid being so. This means there is no longer the need to physically gather in a real space to garner power and take action &ndash; the Internet can serve as a giant, interconnected public space. Thus, the group never truly disperses, and so their power is never forfeit. As such, while the action <em>was</em>, the public space and its power still <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>
	The very same can be clearly seen with Occupy. Of course, some movements still have personnel in the streets, but more opaquely it is also the case that the Occupy network is constantly abuzz at all hours of the day with information exchange over social networking mediums. Moreover, the nature of Occupy splits from Arendt in that it has designs to maintain efficacy even when the streets are cleared and social networks quiet. Such plans include regular regional and national meetings and the appointment of hierarchical leadership. Due to things like this, it might be better to say that the segments of Occupy and the start of Occupy more grandly would both be more clearly Arendtian than the whole of the program as it currently looks.</p>
<p>
	It is important to be aware both of man&rsquo;s past and man&rsquo;s potential futures, as well as what can be done to avoid repeating the former so as to achieve the best possible version of the latter. We can still act; Egypt, Occupy, and their ilk have showed us this. Moreover, &ldquo;men who because they have received the twofold gift of freedom and action can establish a reality of their own.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn63"" name=""_ftnref63"" title="""">[63]</a> Granted, big goals and systemic changes may seem forever out of reach, and platforms towards such ends untenable. Still, we ought not dwell on this and let it dishearten and frustrate advancement, for &ldquo;our whole existence rests, after all, on a chain of miracles, as it were.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn64"" name=""_ftnref64"" title="""">[64]</a></p>

&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"">Naming the enemy has, heretofore, been considered impolite, and impolitic. One mustn&#39;t exclude, target, or commit class war. Anyone can be an ally; trot out Warren Buffett or George Soros. Postmodernism has dedicated itself to rooting out all forms of thought that exclude, denounce, or express moral certitude, worrying (understandably) about where such judgments might land and who might get scapegoated, remembering the fate of Robespierre, himself a Professor of a Revolution who helped create the machine that murdered him. Postmodernists pine for a theory, a language, a politics that won&#39;t turn on itself and cannot be coopted, and they think this will come by refusing to condemn, exhort, or name names. The problem is, of course, that this is another form of absolutism, and it is often delivered with moral certitude. And no theory can solve all of the potential pitfalls of a movement by simply hewing to the correct meta-form. Political strategies can only be corrected in the same place they arise: in the street.</span></p>

&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"">Although there have been recurrent debates over its exact numerical reference, the 1% is in reality a metaphor for the enemy, not meant to be statistically precise. By this term, the enemy is named, not as the mere rich, but as the mega rich, the super rich. All the more galling, then that they have amassed this mega-wealth from nurse aids in for-profit nursing homes and from seamstresses who work for piece rate and from taking the tops off mountains and from buying poor people&#39;s homes to build luxury housing at 300% profit and from clipping coupons on wall street. These are the billionaires, and billionaireses, whose wealth and power is beyond our imagination. And yet, it does not require any conspiracy theories to understand how they came into being, just the capacity to count. The point of naming them is really to isolate them and eventually liquidate their possibility to exist, and to reproduce. </span></p>

	<br />
	In this article they warn their readers that revolutionary social movements that would base themselves on &quot;Karl Marx&rsquo;s class distinction between &#39;haves&#39; and &#39;have-nots&#39;&quot; have historically &quot;led to the... execution and starvation of millions of people.&quot;<br />

	<br />
	Judging by the panicky reaction to OWS by the corporate media, it seems that the US has for so long been obsessed with culture wars and identity politics that when a social movement emerges that explicitly addresses the growing class inequality in this country they imagine it must be Marxist inspired &quot;terrorism.&quot;<br />
	<br />
	Their fearful reaction, however, exposes their own class bias. In their way of thinking, it is not the injustice and inequality of the system that enriches the few at the expense of the many that&#39;s the problem, but the people openly expressing their dissatisfaction with social inequality that is, and they scapegoat them as dangerous and violent types intent on destroying civilization. Marxism, in their imaginary, operates as a catch-all &quot;bogey-man&quot; intended to scare the workers into seeing any resistance to capitalism as &quot;foreign,&quot; &quot;violent,&quot; and a threat to the &quot;American way of life.&quot; </font></font></font><br />

	<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">What Marx&#39;s idea of communism requires is the opposite of belief, of only looking at the world the way we would like it to be rather than understanding how it is. What it means is taking a closer look at the &quot;actual relations springing from an existing class struggle, from a historical movement going on under our very eyes&quot; (</font></font></font><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3""><i>The Communist Manifesto</i></font></font></font><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">). According to Marx, communists &quot;do not confront the world in a doctrinaire way with a new principle: Here is the truth, kneel down before it!&quot; but rather &quot;merely show the world what it is really fighting for&quot; (Marx to Ruge, September 1843). Communism, in Marx&#39;s terms, is thus &quot;not a </font></font></font><em><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">state of affairs</font></font></font></em><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3""> which is to be established, an </font></font></font><em><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">ideal</font></font></font></em><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3""> to which reality [will] have to adjust itself&quot; but &quot;the </font></font></font><em><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">real </font></font></font></em><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">movement which abolishes the present state of things&quot; (Marx and Engels, </font></font></font><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3""><i>The German Ideology</i></font></font></font><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">).<br />
	<br />
	Take class, for example.<br />
	<br />
	On Marx&#39;s terms, class is not merely a problem of the unfair distribution of income between the &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot; that will change by people becoming less greedy and more ethical.<br />
	<br />
	Class, for Marx, explains the global division of labor that exists between those who own and control the means of production of social wealth and those who own nothing but their labor power which they must sell to the employers in order to live. Class inequality will only change, therefore, when the workers end their economic exploitation by capital and take control of production and establish a society in which the rule is &quot;from each according to their ability, to each according to their need&quot; (Marx, </font></font></font><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3""><i>Critique of the Gotha Programme</i></font></font></font><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">).<br />
	<br />
	Like the mainstream commentary, Zizek&#39;s idea of communism as defense of the idea of community only addresses inequality as if it were a problem of the unfair distribution of wealth and power. </font></font></font></p>
<p>
	<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">While Glenn Beck thinks that any re-distribution of wealth from the rich to the poor would create a violent disruption of an otherwise peaceful, fair and just society, Zizek thinks that the re-distribution of wealth from the poor to the rich that has been the norm since Reagan&#39;s presidency is brutal, unjust, and needs to be made fairer.<br />
	<br />
	Communism for Zizek amounts to a fairer distribution of wealth in which we do not sacrifice the common good in order to make a few people rich.<br />
	<br />
	If the OWS protests are communist in the way Zizek argues, however, and what is being protested is only corporate &quot;greed and corruption&quot; as the OWS website says, then it is not the cause of the class inequality that lies in the daily exploitation of labor by capital at the point of production that is being opposed but only the effects of class on culture because of the way it has allowed the special interests of a tiny minority to dominate social and political life.<br />
	<br />
	But by only protesting the cultural effects of class (&quot;greed and corruption&quot;), rather than the cause of the stark inequality that we see, the dominant belief that capitalism may be made &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;democratic&quot; is maintained. The effect of this belief is to make it seem as if the daily exploitation of the working class by the capitalist class is normal and therefore acceptable&mdash;it&#39;</font></font></font><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">s just the way things are and, therefore, ought to be. </font></font></font></p>
<p>
	<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">By making it seem as if the roots of inequality lie in personal greed and unfairness&mdash;and not the law of profit that exploits labor&mdash;it becomes impossible to understand and abolish class inequality at its roots. What Zizek and other &quot;left&quot; theorists promote as &quot;communism&quot; presumes that if we only make the system a little fairer, with a little more regulation of Wall Street and a little more protection for workers, then everything will go back to the way it was in some mythological past and democracy will be restored.</font></font></font></p>
<p>
	<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">However, without a basic understanding of class that critiques the dominant ideology that normalizes capitalism by representing it as open to being made &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;democratic,&quot; it is impossible to change it, and the domination of social and political life by the 1% will continue.<br />
	<br />
	People interested in the Occupy movement sometimes worry that it will be co-opted by the Democrats and diverted from being a movement against social inequality into merely a movement to re-elect Obama and hope for piecemeal reforms.<br />
	<br />
	But given the focus on the &quot;greed and corruption&quot; of corporate rule and given the lack of a critique of capitalism that exposes its basic class inequality and explains why there cannot be democracy while classes exist, it is clear that at the level of ideas OWS has already been co-opted into an ideological support of the existing class system. It is for this reason that even the Republicans are able to use the language of Occupy for their own electoral strategies, as Gingrich and Perry have done by attacking the &quot;vulture capitalism&quot; of Romney&#39;s investment firm. </font></font></font></p>
<p>
	<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">This ideological limitation and accommodation to bourgeois norms means that OWS as it currently exists is a reformist movement that is attempting to save capitalism at a time of crisis rather than a genuine worker&#39;s movement to replace capitalism&mdash;which is a system for making profit for a few off of the labor of the many&mdash;with socialism&mdash;a system whose primary purpose is meeting the needs of the many by abolishing the exploitation of labor by capital.<br />
	<br />
	And yet, what&#39;s driving people into the Occupy protests, whether or not they realize it&mdash;in New York City, in Oakland, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Austin, Charleston, Fort Lauderdale, all over the US and around the world&mdash;is not the corruption of democracy by greedy corporations but the crisis of the capitalist system itself.</font></font></font><br />

	<br />
	<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">Speaking at the OWS encampment in New York City Richard Wolff recently reflected on Marx&#39;s idea of communism (41:36-43:06):<br />

<p>
	<font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">When Marx wrote his critique his image of capitalism&#39;s end was not that it was attacked from outside, was not that it was in danger from &quot;terrorists.&quot; Marx&#39;s argument is that capitalism would survive unless and until the internal contradictions, the things about it that undermine each other, make it collapse and make the people who live in that collapse declare that a new and different system has to be begun. That&#39;s what&#39;s looming here. And Marx if he were here today would have a big grin and probably say, in good German, &quot;I told you so!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p>
	<font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">Leaving aside that the purpose of Wolff&#39;s speech was to popularize a messianic vision of a more just society based on workplace democracy, he is right about one thing: Marx&#39;s original contribution to the idea of communism is that it is an historical and material movement produced by the failure of capitalism not a moral crusade to reform it.</font></font><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3""> </font></font></font></p>
<p>
	<a name=""_GoBack""></a> <font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">Today we are confronted with the fact that capitalism has failed in exactly the way that Marx explained was inevitable.4 </font></font></font><sup><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3""> </font></font></font></sup><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">It has &quot;simplified the class antagonism&quot; (</font></font></font><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3""><i>The Communist Manifesto</i></font></font></font><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">); by concentrating wealth and centralizing power in the hands of a few it has succeeded in dispossessing the masses of people of everything except their labor power. As a result it has revealed that the ruling class &quot;is unfit to rule,&quot; as </font></font></font><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3""><i>The Communist Manifesto </i></font></font></font><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">concludes, &quot;because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his slavery, because it cannot help letting him sink into such a state, that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by him.&quot; And the slaves are thus compelled to fight back.<br />
	<br />
	Capitalism makes communism necessary because it has brought into being an international working class whose common conditions of life give them not only the need but also the economic power to establish a society in which the rule is &quot;from each according to their ability, to each according to their need&quot; (Marx, </font></font></font><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3""><i>Critique of the Gotha Programme</i></font></font></font><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">).<br />
	<br />
	Until and unless we confront the fact that capitalism has once again brought the world to the point of taking sides for or against the system as a whole, communism will continue to be just a bogey-man or a nursery-tale to frighten and soothe the conscience of the owners rather than what it is&mdash;the materialist theory that is an absolute requirement for our emancipation from exploitation and a new society freed from necessity! As Lenin said, &quot;Without revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary movement&quot; (</font></font></font><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3""><i>What Is To Be Done?</i></font></font></font><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Verdana, sans-serif""><font size=""3"">).<br />
	<br />
	We are confronted with an historic crisis of global proportions that demands of us that we take Marxism seriously as something that needs to be studied to find solutions to the problems of today.<br />

	<em>&ldquo;Without music, life would be an error.&rdquo; &ndash;Friedrich Nietzsche, </em>Twilight of the Idols</p>
<p>
	Of all of the charges lobbed at the Occupy Movement&mdash;they are privileged, overeducated, lazy, greedy, leaderless, prescriptionless, immature, filthy, idealistic, dangerous, anarchical, <em>etc</em>.&mdash;none is more curious than what is said of its music.</p>
<p>
	George Will diminished the drum circles in Liberty Plaza as liberal nostalgia and a &ldquo;facet of the Sixties.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1"" title="""">[1]</a> In response to Alan Grayson, former Democratic Congressman from Florida, and his explanation of OWS, on <em>Real Time with Bill Maher</em>, PJ O&rsquo;Rourke quipped, &ldquo;Get the man a bongo drum; they&rsquo;ve found their spokesman!&rdquo; And in an early piece about the Movement, Andrew Grossman at the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>couldn&rsquo;t help but mention the most common injury among Occupiers: blisters from bongo drums.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn2"" name=""_ednref2"" title="""">[2]</a></p>
<p>
	What&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>
	Perhaps the opponents have read their Plato and what he says about how corruptible music can be to the soul&mdash;and to the city. In Book II of Plato&rsquo;s <em>Republic</em>, Socrates posits that a smaller and simpler city is to be preferred to one that is large and disharmonious. In fact, our desire for non-essential things&mdash;Glaucon calls it &ldquo;relishes&rdquo;&mdash;is the cause of war, as cities look to expand their territory to accommodate them. Hence what was once a &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; city soon comes to include &ldquo;all the hunters and imitators, many concerned with figures and colors, many with music; and poets and their helpers, rhapsodes, actors, choral dancers, contractors, and craftsmen of all sorts of equipment.&rdquo; The simple and true city is becomes &ldquo;a bulky mass of things.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn3"" name=""_ednref3"" title="""">[3]</a></p>
<p>
	If material want is the origin of war, then it&rsquo;s also the origin of government; for it creates a need for leaders, or guardians. And we&rsquo;ll also need an education proper to the city. It is a physical education, in the gymnasium; but it&rsquo;s also a musical one. Yet the music can&rsquo;t be of just any kind; it too needs to be consistent with the needs of a just and well-ordered city. That requires the censorship and even compulsion of the poets, story tellers, and musicians. They must tell tales that are correct in form and substance&mdash;&ldquo;songs written in the panharmonic mode and with all rhythms,&rdquo; as Socrates explains.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn4"" name=""_ednref4"" title="""">[4]</a> Put another, less liberal, way, &ldquo;There must be no innovation in gymnastic and music contrary to the established order&hellip;For never are the ways of music moved without the greatest political laws being moved.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn5"" name=""_ednref5"" title="""">[5]</a></p>
<p>
	And we can&rsquo;t forget that Plato was no great fan of democracy. Sure, he calls it a fair and sweet regime that makes possible all sorts of lives, but it&rsquo;s also an unjust regime that&rsquo;s one step away from tyranny, when people misuse their liberty.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn6"" name=""_ednref6"" title="""">[6]</a> In other words, count Plato out of the drum circles.</p>
<p>
	Nietzsche too understood the power of music. Unlike Plato, whose main goal seemed to be ensuring only suitable works would be produced for the sake of preserving the city, Nietzsche saw, at least at first, music in general as a transformative influence, one that could return German culture, and even Western civilization, to its historic heights. The full title of his first significant work (from 1872) was <em>The Birth of Tragedy from of the Spirit of Music</em>. There he writes of how, &ldquo;In song and in dance man expresses himself as a member of a higher community.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn7"" name=""_ednref7"" title="""">[7]</a></p>
<p>
	On hearing Wagner for the first time, Nietzsche wrote: &ldquo;for the life of me I cannot preserve an attitude of cool criticism in listening to this music; every nerve in my being is set tingling.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn8"" name=""_ednref8"" title="""">[8]</a> In the &ldquo;Attempt at Self-criticism&rdquo; added to later versions of <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em>, Nietzsche commented on how &ldquo;art, and <em>not</em> morality, is presented as the truly <em>metaphysical</em> activity of man.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn9"" name=""_ednref9"" title="""">[9]</a> And in the Epilogue he wrote:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&quot;In its measure of strength every age also possessed a measure for what virtues are permitted and forbidden to it. Either it has the virtues of <em>ascending</em> life: then it will resist from the profoundest depths the virtues of declining life. Or the age itself represents declining life: then it also requires the virtues of decline, then it hates everything that justifies itself solely out of abundance, out of the overflowing riches of strength.&quot;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn10"" name=""_ednref10"" title="""">[10]</a></p>
<p>
	But Nietzsche would eventually turn on his teacher and friend&mdash;after Wagner debuted his too-Christian <em>Parsifal</em>. &ldquo;Wagner is merely one of my sicknesses,&rdquo; he would later remark.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn11"" name=""_ednref11"" title="""">[11]</a> Nietzsche&rsquo;s break with Wagner signaled a revaluation of art and culture. This explains why Apollo becomes secondary in Nietzsche&rsquo;s later writings: he came to understand more clearly that culture could only be set right through a tragic philosophy, a Dionysian philosopher. Music in general, and Wagner in particular, was no longer the answer. Art must be driven by philosophy, not the other way around. And in any event, neither was to serve mass democracy.</p>
<p>
	Allan Bloom, author of <em>The Closing of the American Mind</em>, was certainly a close reader of these philosophers. &ldquo;Plato&rsquo;s teaching about music is, put simply, that rhythm and melody, accompanied by dance, are barbarous expressions of the soul,&rdquo; he writes. &ldquo;It is not only not reasonable, it is hostile to reason.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn12"" name=""_ednref12"" title="""">[12]</a> Bloom hoped that a proper liberal (by which he meant conventionally moral) education would moderate our natural passions and desires; that was the stuff civilizations were made of. &ldquo;To Plato and Nietzsche,&rdquo; Bloom observes, &ldquo;the history of music is a series of attempts to give form and beauty to the dark, chaotic, premonitory forces in the soul&mdash;to make them serve a higher purpose, an ideal, to give man&rsquo;s duties a fullness.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn13"" name=""_ednref13"" title="""">[13]</a></p>
<p>
	And it&rsquo;s not just that music will affect that soul; it&rsquo;s what that corrupted soul will do&mdash;namely, want to have sex.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn14"" name=""_ednref14"" title="""">[14]</a> &ldquo;Rock music has one appeal only, a barbaric appeal, to sexual desire&mdash;not love, not <em>eros</em>, but sexual desire undeveloped and untutored,&rdquo; chides Bloom.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn15"" name=""_ednref15"" title="""">[15]</a> It&rsquo;s not so much that music will have a direct or immediate effect, but that it will affect the ability to young people to receive a proper education.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn16"" name=""_ednref16"" title="""">[16]</a></p>
<p>
	Bloom sounds a little dated&mdash;and just a little closed minded&mdash;and not just for his attack on those crazy kids and their &ldquo;rock music.&rdquo; Even so, it&rsquo;s more than just rock and roll he should be worried about. As Ambrose Leung and Cheryl Kier have concluded in an article from <em>Journal of Youth Studies</em>, not all music subverts equally; indeed, classical, opera, musicals, world music, new age, house, heavy metal, punk, ska, and even easy listening (?!) all are associated with more politically active listeners. (It turns out, somewhat surprisingly, that hip hop, rap, R&amp;B, and pop have a negative association with activism.)<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn17"" name=""_ednref17"" title="""">[17]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;What kind of music do we see at OWS? And to what extent is it corrupting souls, risking civilizations, and making people horny?</p>
<p>
	I took a group of students to New York in October, in conjunction with The City, a class I taught in the Fall of 2011. The students were interested in seeing the Occupy protestors, so, after a relatively dull tour around Times Square, we went to where the real action was.</p>
<p>
	There were drummers drumming and dancers dancing, and there were even nappers napping. But mostly the music seemed incidental to what everyone was doing&mdash;which was just trying to live and draw attention to the issues of the Movement.</p>
<p>
	Seeing such dedication made me want to do something. I&rsquo;m probably too old and way too soft to sleep outside, I too quickly surmised, but I wanted to <em>do something.</em> I don&rsquo;t know that I agree with everything associated with the Movement (or if they agree with themselves), but they are drawing attention to important issues related to social mobility, economic inequalities, and corporate responsibility. Plus, if nothing else, I can&rsquo;t help but worry about my students&mdash;their preparedness, their professional prospects, their chance at a purposeful and happy life. And what kind of world are they heading in to?</p>
<p>
	It was inspiring to see so many young people stand up for what they believe in. After spending years hammering that message home in my courses, I couldn&rsquo;t help but want to participate in some way. I decided I wanted to go down there and play some songs for them.</p>
<p>
	I spent the next few weeks putting together a list of appropriate songs and memorizing lyrics (mostly in my car). I enlisted a former bandmate of mine, Christian Laursen, who I knew would be sympathetic to the Movement. He liked the name I came up with for us to play under: Golden Shower Parachutes.</p>
<p>
	After a one-off run through and a two-week illness-related delay, we ended up there on a Saturday in November. It was sunny and crisp and very crowded. Apart from the people who were camped out, there were countless locals and tourists who were down there just to check out the scene.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to play some songs,&rdquo; I said to the woman at the Information Desk, who, more than anyone else, looked like she might be in charge&mdash;or at least in the know. &ldquo;Where should we set up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Wherever you like,&rdquo; she somewhat laughingly responded.</p>
<p>
	A little after 1:00, we jumped up on a marble foundation on the corner of Broadway and Liberty and kicked into Bob Dylan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tombstone Blues.&rdquo; It was windy and loud, and I could barely hear myself play or sing. Out of necessity, our guitar strumming became a bit more deliberate, and I had to sing louder. A few people stopped, some slowed down, but mostly people kept walking. It wasn&rsquo;t the immediate revolution that I had anticipated, but at least we were joining in the fun. We didn&rsquo;t have an order to what we were planning on doing, so we played it by ear, as it were, and quickly went through songs by Rage Against the Machine, Billy Bragg, and the White Stripes.</p>
<p>
	There&rsquo;s nothing like the look on someone&rsquo;s face when they&rsquo;re walking by and recognize a song you&rsquo;re playing. (That happened a lot when we played Arcade Fire&rsquo;s &ldquo;City With No Children.&rdquo;) It&rsquo;s instant community.</p>
<p>
	In addition to the walkers-by, some would stop and watch and even sing along. I even got a handful of young people to play our tambourine and the shakers I brought.</p>
<p>
	Around mid-performance, someone came up and requested an original song and videotaped our performance. We played a song (&ldquo;Get Love&rdquo;) that I wrote about the Movement. It was the first time I had ever played the song for anyone.</p>
<p>
	After we went through our set, we started just strumming chords and singing the words on the signs that people held up as they walked by. Everyone loved to have their signs sung back to them. Then we did our set again for a new crowd.</p>
<p>
	Countless people wanted pictures of us or us and them, and at some point, I was approached by a documentarian, who wanted me to sing the Arabic word for freedom. After she told me how to pronounce it (<em>hurriyya</em>), I started singing it over of a chord progression we had been playing, and Christian joined in with some harmonies. She was thrilled. &ldquo;You just made our documentary,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to put it at the very end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The highlight of the afternoon was when we played (John Lennon&rsquo;s) &ldquo;Power to the People.&rdquo; During the second chorus, I glanced to my right, and saw this elderly woman&mdash;she must have been in her mid- to late-60s&mdash;holding up her fist and singing with me. I&rsquo;ll never forget it.</p>
<p>
	There was more than music and more than politics going on that day, in my mind at least. To drive that point home, my friend and roommate, Brendan Murphy, came down to meet us that day&mdash;to see us play and to support the Occupiers. While he was walking around, he saw a sign asking for shower facilities. We ended up having two guys (Kent and Johnny) from California come up to our apartment in Astoria. They used our shower&mdash;they hadn&rsquo;t had a shower in a week or so&mdash;we made them tea, which eventually become dinner, and gave them some clothes. (They lost a good bit of their stuff after the raid, which happened earlier that week.) We offered to let them sleep on our floor, but they wanted to be with their friends, so they ended up heading off to&mdash;I think&mdash;a church in Manhattan.</p>
<p>
	Music might not have been central to what was going on that day. But it was for me, and its ability to bring people together can&rsquo;t be discounted.</p>
<p>
	Clearly, Plato, Nietzsche, and Bloom are not the philosophers for the Occupy Movement. They might be radicals, but they are the wrong kind of radicals.</p>
<p>
	But Theodor Adorno&rsquo;s critique of music has something to offer us. &ldquo;The role of music in the social process is exclusively that of a commodity,&rdquo; he laments; &ldquo;its value is that determined by the market. Music no longer serves direct needs nor benefits from direct application, but rather adjusts to the pressures of the exchange of abstract units.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn18"" name=""_ednref18"" title="""">[18]</a></p>
<p>
	Inspired by Adorno, Michael Bull, in his <em>Sound Moves</em>, has found that iPod technology might have made the workplace more pleasurable (in that you can chose to replace the music or noise of the office or factory with something of your own choosing), but it hasn&rsquo;t made it any more communal. We merely use our choice of music to work more efficiently.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn19"" name=""_ednref19"" title="""">[19]</a> Nevertheless, &ldquo;we cannot close our ears to the world,&rdquo; he concludes; &ldquo;and it is this very openness that constitutes their democratic nature.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn20"" name=""_ednref20"" title="""">[20]</a> In a piece coauthored with Les Black, Bull puts it rather succinctly, &ldquo;Sound connects us in ways that vision does not.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn21"" name=""_ednref21"" title="""">[21]</a></p>
<p>
	Commercial music and the individualized technology that has come to play it have resulted in a &ldquo;mediated we-ness&rdquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s Adorno, again. Rather than having music bring us together, we are using it to keep us apart. Or maybe the philosopher John Coltrane said it best: &ldquo;the audience heard &lsquo;we&rsquo; everywhere the singer said &lsquo;I.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn22"" name=""_ednref22"" title="""">[22]</a></p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;s not only the easy commodification that&rsquo;s at work here. It&rsquo;s also a question of the active versus the passive. In <em>This is Your Brain on Music</em>, Daniel J. Levitin writes:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&quot;Whenever humans come together for any reason: music is there&hellip;Only relatively recently in our culture, five hundred years ago or so, did a distinction arise that cut society in two, forming separate classes of music performers and music listeners. Throughout most of the world and for most of human history, music making was as natural an activity as breathing and walking, and <em>everyone participated</em>.&quot;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn23"" name=""_ednref23"" title="""">[23]</a></p>
<p>
	If passive consumption is the problem, then non-commercialized participation is the solution.</p>
<p>
	And it&rsquo;s not just the playing; it&rsquo;s the playing together. Others, including Alfred Schutz and Peter J. Martin have treated the reciprocal nature of collective music making as a kind of dialogue between the Other&mdash;a &ldquo;mutual tuning-in relationship,&rdquo; as Schutz puts it.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn24"" name=""_ednref24"" title="""">[24]</a></p>
<p>
	In any event, it seems clear that opponents of OWS are not objecting to the music because it&rsquo;s silly or pointless; they&rsquo;re deeply suspicious of it because it&rsquo;s evidence that the Movement has real traction. Whether it&rsquo;s a full-on drum circle or just two friends with borrowed songs looking to make a difference, the people might actually have the power.</p>
<p>
	But to say that music is powerful is to actually diminish what it can do. Music does not convey or transfer power: it transcends it.</p>

	<strong>Whiteness and the 99%</strong></p>
<p>
	Joel Olson</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Occupy Wall Street and the hundreds of occupations it has sparked nationwide are among the most inspiring events in the U.S. in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The occupations have brought together people to talk, occupy, and organize in new and exciting ways. The convergence of so many people with so many concerns has naturally created tensions within the occupation movement. One of the most significant tensions has been over race.&nbsp; This is not unusual, given the racial history of the United States.&nbsp; But this tension is particularly dangerous, for unless it is confronted, we cannot build the 99%. <em>The key obstacle to building the 99% is left colorblindness, and the key to overcoming it is to put the struggles of communities of color at the center of this movement</em>.&nbsp; It is the difference between a free world and the continued dominance of the 1%.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Left colorblindess is the enemy</strong></p>
<p>
	Left colorblindness is the belief that race is a &ldquo;divisive&rdquo; issue among the 99%, so we should instead focus on problems that &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; shares. According to this argument, the movement is for everyone, and people of color should join it rather than attack it.</p>
<p>
	Left colorblindness claims to be inclusive, but it is actually just another way to keep whites&rsquo; interests at the forefront. It tells people of color to join &ldquo;our&rdquo; struggle (who makes up this &ldquo;our,&rdquo; anyway?) but warns them not to bring their &ldquo;special&rdquo; concerns into it. It enables white people to decide which issues are for the 99% and which ones are &ldquo;too narrow.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s another way for whites to expect and insist on favored treatment, even in a democratic movement.</p>
<p>
	As long as left colorblindness dominates our movement, there will be no 99%. There will instead be a handful of whites claiming to speak for everyone. When people of color have to enter a movement on white people&rsquo;s terms rather than their own, that&rsquo;s not the 99%. That&rsquo;s white democracy.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>The white democracy</strong></p>
<p>
	Biologically speaking, there&rsquo;s no such thing as race. As hard as they&rsquo;ve tried, scientists have never been able to define it. That&rsquo;s because race is a human creation, not a fact of nature. Like money, it only exists because people accept it as &ldquo;real.&rdquo; Races exist because humans invented them.</p>
<p>
	Why would people invent race? Race was created in America in the late 1600s in order to preserve the land and power of the wealthy. Rich planters in Virginia feared what might happen if indigenous tribes, slaves, and indentured servants united and overthrew them. So, they cut a deal with the poor English colonists. The planters gave the English poor certain rights and privileges denied to all persons of African and Native American descent: the right to never be enslaved, to free speech and assembly, to move about without a pass, to marry without upper-class permission, to change jobs, to acquire property, and to bear arms. In exchange, the English poor agreed to respect the property of the rich, help them seize indigenous lands, and enforce slavery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	This cross-class alliance between the rich and the English poor came to be known as the &ldquo;white race.&rdquo; By accepting preferential treatment in an economic system that exploited their labor, too, the white working class tied their wagon to the elite rather than the rest of humanity. This devil&rsquo;s bargain has undermined freedom and democracy in the U.S. ever since.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
<img alt="""" src=""http://bringtheruckus.org/files/cca.jpg"" style=""width: 350px; height: 204px; "" /></p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	<em>The cross-class alliance that makes up the white race.</em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	As this white race expanded to include other European ethnicities, the result was a very curious political system: the <em>white democracy</em>.&nbsp; The white democracy has two contradictory aspects to it.&nbsp; On the one hand, all whites are considered equal (even as the poor are subordinated to the rich and women are subordinated to men). On the other, every white person is considered superior to every person of color. It&rsquo;s democracy for white folks, but tyranny for everyone else.</p>
<p>
	In this system, whites praised freedom, equal opportunity, and hard work, while at the same time insisting on higher wages, access to the best jobs, to be the first hired and the last fired at the workplace, full enjoyment of civil rights, the right to send their kids to the best schools, to live in the nicest neighborhoods, and to enjoy decent treatment by the police. In exchange for these &ldquo;public and psychological wages,&rdquo; as W.E.B. Du Bois called them, whites agreed to enforce slavery, segregation, reservation, genocide, and other forms of discrimination.&nbsp; The tragedy of the white democracy is that it oppressed working class whites as well as people of color, because with the working class bitterly divided, the elites could rule easily.</p>
<p>
	The white democracy exists today. Take any social indicator&mdash;rates for college graduation, homeownership, median family wealth, incarceration, life expectancy, infant mortality, cancer, unemployment, median family debt, etc.&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll find the same thing: whites as a group are significantly better off than any other racial group. Of course there are individual exceptions, but as a group whites enjoy more wealth, less debt, more education, less imprisonment, more health care, less illness, more safety, less crime, better treatment by the police, and less police brutality than any other group. Some whisper that this is because whites have a better work ethic. But history tells us that the white democracy, born in the 1600s, lives on.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>The distorted white mindset</strong></p>
<p>
	No one is opposed to good schools, safe neighborhoods, healthy communities, and economic security for whites. The problem is that in the white democracy, whites often enjoy these <em>at the expense of communities of color.</em>&nbsp; This creates a distorted mindset among many whites: they praise freedom yet support a system that clearly favors the rich, even at the expense of poor whites. (Tea Party, I&rsquo;m talking to <em>you</em>.)</p>
<p>
	The roots of left colorblindness lie in the white democracy and the distorted mindset it creates.&nbsp; It encourages whites to think that their issues are &ldquo;universal&rdquo; while those of people of color are &ldquo;specific.&rdquo;&nbsp; But that is exactly backwards.&nbsp; The struggles of people of color are the problems that everyone shares. Anyone in the occupy movement who has been treated brutally by the police has to know that Black communities are terrorized by cops every day.&nbsp; Anyone who is unemployed has to know that Black unemployment rates are always at least double that of whites, and Native American unemployment rates are far higher. Anyone who is sick and lacks healthcare has to know that people of color are the least likely to be insured (regardless of their income) and have the highest infant mortality and cancer rates and the lowest life expectancy rates.&nbsp; Anyone who is drowning in debt should know that the median net wealth of Black households is twenty times less than that of white households.&nbsp; Only left colorblindness can lead us to ignore these facts.</p>
<p>
	This is the sinister impact of white democracy on our movements.&nbsp; It encourages a mindset that insists that racial issues are &ldquo;divisive&rdquo; <em>when they are at the absolute center of everything we are fighting for</em>.</p>
<p>
	To defeat left colorblindness and the distorted white mindset, we must come to see any form of favoritism toward whites (whether explicit or implicit) as an evil attempt to perpetuate the cross-class alliance rather than build the 99%.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>The only thing that can stop us is us</strong></p>
<p>
	Throughout American history, attacking the white democracy has always opened up radical possibilities for <em>all</em> people. The abolitionist movement not only overthrew slavery, it kicked off the women&rsquo;s rights and labor movements. The civil rights struggle not only overthrew legal segregation, it kicked off the women&rsquo;s rights, free speech, student, queer, Chicano, Puerto Rican, and American Indian movements. When the pillars of the white democracy tremble, everything is possible.</p>
<p>
	The only thing that can stop us is us. What prevents the 99% from organizing the world as we see fit is not the 1%. The 1% cannot hold on to power if we decide they shouldn&rsquo;t. What keeps us from building the new world in our hearts are the divisions among us.</p>
<p>
	Our diversity is our strength. But left colorblindness is a <em>rejection</em> of diversity. It is an effort to keep white interests at the center of the movement even as the movement claims to be open to all. Urging us to &ldquo;get over&rdquo; so-called &ldquo;divisive&rdquo; issues like race sound inclusive, but they are really efforts to maintain the white democracy. It&rsquo;s like Wall Street executives telling us to &ldquo;get beyond&rdquo; &ldquo;divisive&rdquo; issues like their unfair profits because if you work hard enough, you too can get a job on Wall Street someday!</p>
<p>
	Creating a 99% requires putting the struggles of people of color at the center of our conversations and demands rather than relegating them to the margins. To fight against school segregation, colonization, redlining, and anti-immigrant attacks is to fight against everything Wall Street stands for, everything the Tea Party stands for, everything this government stands for. It is to fight against the white democracy, which stands at the path to a free society like a troll at the bridge.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Occupy everything, attack the white democracy</strong></p>
<p>
	While no pamphlet can capture everything a nationwide movement can or should do to undermine the white democracy and left colorblindness, below is a short list of questions people might consider asking in movement debates.&nbsp; These questions were developed from actual debates in occupations throughout the U.S.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.75in;"">
	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do speakers urge us &ldquo;get beyond&rdquo; race?&nbsp; Are they defensive and dismissive of demands for racial justice?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.75in;"">
	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If speakers urge developing &ldquo;close working relationships with the police,&rdquo; do they consider how police terrorize Black, Latino, Native, and undocumented communities? Do they consider how police have attacked occupation encampments?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.75in;"">
	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If speakers urge us to hold banks accountable, do they encourage us to focus on redlining, predatory lending, and subprime mortgages, which have decimated Black and Latino neighborhoods?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.75in;"">
	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If speakers urge the cancellation of debts, do they mean for things like electric and heating bills as well as home mortgages and college loans?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.75in;"">
	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If speakers urge the halting of foreclosures, do they acknowledge that they take place primarily in segregated neighborhoods, and do they propose to start there?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.75in;"">
	&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If speakers urge the creation of more jobs, do they acknowledge that many communities of color have already been in chronic &ldquo;recessions&rdquo; for decades, and do they propose to start from there?</p>

	<strong>The &ldquo;Occupy&rdquo; Movement and the Politics to Come</strong></p>
<p>
	In this essay, I would like to consider the current &ldquo;occupy&rdquo; movement and its relation to some ways of thinking about the nature of politics and the future of political thought and action.&nbsp; My aim will be to consider a series of relevant and potentially helpful ideas in recent political thought and to suggest that we might understand the potential of the movement to produce political change and transformation partly in terms of these ideas.&nbsp; I will argue, in particular, that the &ldquo;occupy&rdquo; movement has the <em>potential </em>to develop an innovative kind of conceptualization and <em>praxis </em>of politics, a kind of &ldquo;politics beyond the <em>polis</em>&rdquo; that creates new ideas and possibilities of political thought and action, and which is also anticipated by several leading contemporary political theorists.&nbsp; This is not to say that the movement <em>will</em> necessarily continue to develop in the specific directions I am considering here, or even necessarily that it should.&nbsp; I aim simply to extract a series of concepts that may prove helpful to some in thinking about theoretical bases for the kinds of organization and practice that the &ldquo;occupy&rdquo; movement has exhibited so far, and could possibly carry further.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Politics beyond the <em>polis</em> </strong></p>
<p>
	For those who took to parks, streets, and public spaces in the fall of 2011, beginning with Zuccotti park in Manhattan but soon spreading across the USA and around the world, the meaning of &ldquo;occupying&rdquo; is basically a <em>political </em>one.&nbsp; Yet the actions and interventions that began in New York typically do not orient themselves toward any specific political party or any narrow set of policy recommendations in the sense of the established electoral, administrative, and bureaucratic politics of the USA, or any other state.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, one of the greatest potentials of the movement appears to the prospect that it may, going beyond existing positions and policies, offer to fundamentally reconfigure the space of &ldquo;political&rdquo; thought and action itself.&nbsp; But what kind of &ldquo;political&rdquo; action is it to <em>occupy</em>?&nbsp; And even in the wake of the forced removal of most &ldquo;occupy&rdquo; protestors from initial occupation sights in the fall and winter of 2011, what might it mean for the prospect of a movement founded on the simple action of occupation &ndash; in any of the various senses of this term, not limited to physically taking up spaces, but extending to actions of repossession, appropriation, and liberation, both in physical and virtual &ldquo;space&rdquo; &ndash; not only to intervene within, but to change fundamentally, the very space in which we today talk about, think about, and take action with respect to politics and the political?</p>
<p>
	To consider these questions, it is helpful to begin with Aristotle&rsquo;s classic definition of the &ldquo;state&rdquo; or <em>polis</em>, at the opening of his <em>Politics</em>:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	Every state (<em>polis</em>) is a community of some kind, and every community is established with a view to some good; for everyone always acts in order to obtain what they think good.&nbsp; But, if all communities aim at some good, the state or political community, which is the highest of all, and which embraces all the rest, aims at good in a greater degree than any other, and at the highest good.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/Paul/Desktop/Livingston%20-%20The%20'occupy'%20movement%20and%20the%20politics%20to%20come.doc#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a></p>
<p>
	Aristotle&rsquo;s classic definition of the <em>polis</em> contains two ideas that are essential prerequisites for any thinking of the political today.&nbsp; The first is the idea of a community &ndash; an association, or <em>koinonia</em> &ndash; which forms the basis, according to Aristotle, for every possible organization of the <em>polis</em>.&nbsp; This is an idea of the fundamental <em>foundation </em>of the political organization in the unity of the common, in the commonality of interests, desires, identities and hopes that makes possible, for Aristotle, any form of coherent social organization.&nbsp; Though Aristotle himself does not define it this way here, the <em>polis</em> is understood, by Aristotle and other Greek thinkers, as the organizing &ldquo;center&rdquo; of the social life of a community, the fixed and firm &ldquo;pole&rdquo; around which all actions, laws, and practices must inevitably orbit.&nbsp; This is a spatial and territorial idea of the state, the conception of a people grouping itself together in the unity of shared interests that comes from inhabiting the same centered space.&nbsp; The second idea, always in a certain tension with the first, is the idea of the directedness of this form of association toward the <em>good</em> &ndash; toward what we can hope for and work to bring about through this unity of interests or of identities, of values or of needs.&nbsp; Aristotle conceives these two aspects &ndash; the unity of the center and the openness toward the good &ndash; as the essential basis as well as the essential form of the political &ldquo;common,&rdquo; and so lays the foundation for the two-thousand year Western history of the politics of the state.</p>
<p>
	If, however, we are to take seriously today the second idea, of a fundamental directedness to the good, it is first necessary that we examine once again the first idea, that of the unity of the community in the centering substance of the &ldquo;polis.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the classical concept of the &ldquo;polis&rdquo; which Aristotle presupposes and deploys appears today to be less founded, secure, and certain than ever, and, as I shall try to show, one of the great potentials of the &ldquo;occupy&rdquo; movement may be that it effectively <em>stages</em> this insecurity in a way that points toward new forms of organization and directedness toward the good that <em>can no longer be understood as</em> <em>the unity of a community or find its direct and unproblematic expression in the politics of a state.</em>&nbsp; This is so for various reasons, all connected to the changes and transformations that the concept and reality of the state has undergone since antiquity, which have accelerated in the twentieth century and into the twenty-first.&nbsp; First, any serious thinking about the state and politics today must come to terms with the dramatic and vast <em>expansion</em> of the powers and authorities of the state in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, an expansion that goes hand-in-hand with the world-dominating symbiosis of state governments (led by the U.S.) and non-state, global forms of capitalist economic <em>praxis</em>, including global industrialization, the development of &ldquo;information&rdquo; economies, and, perhaps most importantly today, the dramatic and rapid growth of speculative finance capital.&nbsp; But second, and simultaneously, it is evident that the sovereignty and power of states in the traditional, territorial sense of that term is today undergoing a dramatic and radical <em>crisis</em> of authority, a crisis witnessed in ever more desperate and violent attempts to control borders, securitize resources, and ensure global military and juridical hegemony.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	From its beginnings on Wall Street, the &ldquo;occupy&rdquo; movement has been focused, in large measure, on the massive and systematic inequities of the global financial order, the structural inequalities that led to the crises of 2008 but have still not been addressed in any fundamental way by any effective power either within or without state politics.&nbsp; And the brutal and spectacular instances of police violence that we have seen in response demonstrate unequivocally the decisive investments of state power in the material defense of this existing trans-state global financial structure.&nbsp; If, then, those in the movement understand that the electoral and administrative politics of the state exist, today, largely, if not exclusively, in service to these economic formations, it must also be acknowledged that the essential link envisaged by Aristotle between the state and the common good has effectively been broken.&nbsp; For as the crisis of 2008 spectacularly demonstrates, the global order of financial capital serves the good of only a narrow and select few, and above all exists primarily in service of the privilege of these few and the perpetuation of its own inegalitarian structure.&nbsp; But if the modern reality of state and capitalist politics has essentially privileged the structure of the state (in the extended significance whereby it comprehends global economic structures as well), the challenge of the coming politics is to conceive of the fundamental possibility of directedness toward the good outside the structure of any form of state organization, to think the good <em>otherwise</em> than as the &ldquo;common&rdquo; of the <em>polis</em>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The problem of the massive and inegalitarian dominance of the state by trans-national global structures could not have been envisaged by Aristotle, for whom <em>oiko-nomia</em> still meant only the order and management of the <em>oikos</em>, or household.&nbsp; But if the administrative, military and police power of the <em>polis</em> today functions largely in defense of the fundamentally inegalitarian global economic order, then the challenge for any thinking of the possibility of a politics to come is the problem of thinking a politics that is, in a certain way, beyond or outside the <em>polis</em>.&nbsp; Because it is no longer possible to understand the unity of the state as a simple, territorial one, and because the power of the state tends ever more to devote itself to the defense of a trans-state order that has little or nothing to do with the unity of a &ldquo;common&rdquo; good, political thought is thus challenged to think, and bring about, the unity of a community that has no allegiance to the global order of capital or to any existing state formation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	This, in any case, is the provocative claim of the contemporary philosopher Giorgio Agamben, who in his remarkable 1990 book, <em>The Coming Community</em>, imagines the &ldquo;community to come&rdquo; as a unity of singularities without common identity, territory, or center:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	<em>The novelty of the coming politics is that it will no longer be a struggle for the conquest or control of the State, but a struggle between the State and the non-State (humanity), an insurmountable disjunction between whatever singularity and the State organization.&nbsp; </em>This has nothing to do with the simple affirmation of the social in opposition to the State that has often found expression in the protest movements of recent years.&nbsp; Whatever singularities cannot form a <em>societas</em> because they do not possess any identity to vindicate nor any bond of belonging for which to seek recognition.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/Paul/Desktop/Livingston%20-%20The%20'occupy'%20movement%20and%20the%20politics%20to%20come.doc#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a></p>
<p>
	According to Agamben, the political struggles of the future will thus demand the emergence of a transformative politics of what he calls the &ldquo;whatever singularity;&rdquo; this is an actor or being whose claim to recognition does not rest in any shared essence, culture, or identity, but rather, as Agamben explains, in its simple <em>existence</em>, in its &ldquo;being-there&rdquo; itself.&nbsp; The community to come of &ldquo;whatever singularities&rdquo;, then, is a community without the unity of shared identity, a community whose members are so radically different from one another that they do not and cannot form even the unity of an organic &ldquo;society.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here we see the ultimate consequence of the contemporary crisis of the <em>polis</em>, and face the challenge of the possibility of a politics to come that does not any longer orient itself with respect to the centering unity of the state.&nbsp; As Agamben suggests, this challenge is the one that must be faced by any political movement that seeks to respond to the massively unbinding and alienating totality of the global capitalist order, and to arrive at new forms of community and collective life that can eventually supplant and defeat it.&nbsp; If &ldquo;occupy&rdquo; is to be such a movement, then, it apparently must involve a radical new thinking of the possibility of community itself, outside the organization of any <em>polis</em> as well as any unity of essence or identity.&nbsp; Here, it is inadequate simply to call (as some have on behalf of the movement) simply for a new and non-capitalist &ldquo;politics of the commons&rdquo; or for a theorization the possibilities of futural non-state politics simply on the basis of existing concepts of community or commonality.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/Paul/Desktop/Livingston%20-%20The%20'occupy'%20movement%20and%20the%20politics%20to%20come.doc#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a>&nbsp; Rather, it is a dramatic challenge to <em>thought</em> which is at the same time a profound challenge to practice and action: the challenge to think the very possibility of a collective directedness toward the good anew, outside the guarantee of any substantial unity or any correspondence of essence, and without the assurance of the concept of the centered <em>polis</em> which has sustained Western political thought since its inception.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>The <em>khorology</em> of politics: occupying, spacing, and making space</strong></p>
<p>
	Since its beginning of the &ldquo;occupy&rdquo; movement, commentators and critics have often noted the <em>relative</em> absence of concrete demands and policy recommendations that distinguishes the practice and action of &ldquo;occupy&rdquo; protestors from those of many other protest movements, present and past.&nbsp; This is not to say, however, that the movement lacks concrete ideas or has failed to implement action directed <em>precisely</em> toward the most important inequalities and structural failures of the current configuration.&nbsp; The first and foremost of these actions has been, of course, <em>occupation </em>itself.&nbsp; If the movement has indeed largely, if not completely, lacked concrete, direct recommendations or programs on the level of immediate policy, and thus has seemed in certain ways unrecognizable from the perspective of current mainstream &ldquo;politics,&rdquo; this may, as I shall argue, be simply an inherent consequence of its effectivity on a <em>different</em> level of political action and <em>praxis</em>, the level on which the act of occupying, in itself, points toward the possibility of a transformed politics and another kind of collective life.</p>
<p>
	But what is the meaning of &ldquo;occupying,&rdquo; if it does not issue immediately in recommendations and demands on the level of state or economic policy?&nbsp; Does the direct action of protestors who took to streets, parks, and public places then amount simply to the (perhaps &ldquo;subversive&rdquo; but hardly transformative) act of &ldquo;taking up space&rdquo;?&nbsp; As I shall argue, the significance of &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; may be far broader than this, amounting not simply to &ldquo;taking up space&rdquo; but rather, much more significantly, to <em>making</em> the plural spaces in which genuinely democratic forms of life and the politics grounded in them can arise and flourish.&nbsp; For essential reasons, this making of space doesn&rsquo;t immediately issue in recommendations to be followed or demands to be realized; its burden is the much more profound task of creating the fragile possibility of new kinds of collective <em>praxis</em> that articulate the forms of a life to come.</p>
<p>
	Once again, we can turn to recent political thought, in its dialogue with the fundamental concepts of western political thought and action, for some helpful conceptual guidelines.&nbsp; In his jointly political and cosmological dialogue <em>Timeaus</em>, Plato considers the relationship between ideas, which are intelligible only by means of thinking, and the objects of the senses.&nbsp; In addition to these two types of being and mediating between them, he says, there is also necessarily a certain &ldquo;third genus&rdquo;, neither sensible nor intelligible in itself, but that which mediates between them, making possible the sensible <em>as well as</em> the intelligible by giving space and making a place for all that is.&nbsp; To designate this &ldquo;third genus&rdquo; which mediates between and unsettles the opposition of thought and materiality, Plato uses a word which also had, for the Greeks, a more general signification of &ldquo;place&rdquo; or &ldquo;area.&rdquo; &nbsp;The term is <em>kh</em><em>&ocirc;ra</em>:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&hellip;we must agree that One Kind is the self-identical Form, ungenerated and indestructible, neither receiving into itself any other from any quarter nor itself passing any whither into another, invisible and in all ways imperceptible by sense, it being the object which it is the province of Reason to contemplate; and a second Kind is that which is named after the former and similar thereto, an object perceptible by sense, generated, ever carried about, becoming in a place and out of it again perishing, apprehensible by Opinion with the aid of Sensation; and a third Kind is ever-existing Place (<em>kh</em><em>&ocirc;ra</em>),which admits not of destruction, and provides room for all things that have birth, itself being apprehensible by a kind of bastard reasoning by the aid of non-sensation, barely an object of belief; for when we regard this we dimly dream and affirm that it is somehow necessary that all that exists should exist&nbsp;in&nbsp;some spot and occupying some&nbsp;place, and that that which is neither on earth nor anywhere in the Heaven is nothing.&nbsp;(51e-52b)<a href=""file:///C:/Users/Paul/Desktop/Livingston%20-%20The%20'occupy'%20movement%20and%20the%20politics%20to%20come.doc#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""">[4]</a></p>
<p>
	In a far-ranging 1993 essay, Jacques Derrida revisits the meaning of <em>kh&ocirc;ra</em>, considering its implications for a deconstructive interpretation of the problems of contemporary thought and action.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/Paul/Desktop/Livingston%20-%20The%20'occupy'%20movement%20and%20the%20politics%20to%20come.doc#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title="""">[5]</a>&nbsp; In a peculiar and interesting way, Derrida argues, the concept of <em>kh&ocirc;ra</em> destabilizes from with the whole host of oppositions on which Plato&rsquo;s philosophy and all the philosophical systems that follow from it depend.&nbsp; These oppositions &ndash; between the thinkable and the sensible, the ideal and the real, thought and action themselves &ndash; have also organized the politics of the West, and, as Derrida notes, in its effective destabilizing of these terms of opposition the <em>kh&ocirc;ra</em> has an exemplary and singular <em>political </em>significance as well.&nbsp; Indeed, it is not insignificant, Derrida suggests, that within the <em>Timeaus</em> &ldquo;this <em>mise en abyme</em> [of the <em>kh&ocirc;ra</em>] affects the forms of a discourse on places, notably political places, a politics of place entirely commanded by the consideration of sites (jobs in the society, region, territory, country), as sites assigned to types or forms of discourse&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp; (p. 104).&nbsp; The thinking of <em>kh&ocirc;ra</em> is thus, according to Derrida, the thinking of a kind of impossible spacing, a condition of the possibility of space and place that itself cannot be thought on the basis of any positive concept or sensible object.&nbsp; As such, it first makes possible the space of any possible political life, the place of any positing of goals or any realization of aims.&nbsp; It conditions the spacing and placing of anything like a political community, or the radically undecidable space in which anything like a political project can first take place.</p>
<p>
	In its more general sense, <em>kh&ocirc;ra</em> can mean the place or region of a community, the open and environing region within which the city takes shape and begins to pursue a collective life.&nbsp; It is the opening of space in which the exchange and negotiation of public life first become possible.&nbsp; Yet the significance of <em>kh&ocirc;ra</em> is both broader then, and different from, that of the <em>agora</em>, the central place of assembly and political decision, but also the marketplace, in which the Athens of Socrates and Plato conducted the business of exchange and Socrates pursued his unceasing inquiry into the values of the city.&nbsp; If it is the case, as Derrida suggests, that every regular configuration of political thought and action depends on the undecidability of the <em>kh&ocirc;ra,</em> then its opening or spacing also necessarily precedes any positing of goals, announcement of projects, or negotiation of ends.&nbsp; That the <em>kh&ocirc;ra</em> is a structurally necessary &ldquo;third genus&rdquo; between the ideal and the material means that the opening of the <em>kh&ocirc;ra</em> must, necessarily, precede any possible politics of ideal ends or their substantive realization.&nbsp; And that the <em>kh&ocirc;ra </em>necessarily precedes the opposition between thought and action in this way means that the opening of the <em>kh&ocirc;ra</em> can provide a radical alternative to the contemporary mainstream politics of the globalized <em>agora</em>, the economic-political marketplace of capital in which all ideas, policies and projects are (always already) bought and sold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	If this is right, then it seems possible that the most radical implication of the praxis of an occupation without demands may be that it accomplishes this opening of <em>kh&ocirc;ra</em>, the opening of a space of political and collective life whose structure is, at the deepest level, different from that of the contemporary global economics and politics of markets and administration.&nbsp; Far from simply &ldquo;taking up space,&rdquo; the act of occupying might be seen, in and of itself, as the paradoxical act of &ldquo;making space,&rdquo; opening and creating the spacing that makes another kind of political thinking and acting possible.&nbsp; This would, again, be the creation of the space for a democracy without policy or polls, the space of a collective politics and action that thinks, and lives, otherwise.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Critical politics of the whole</strong>: <strong>generic being of the life to come</strong></p>
<p>
	In each of these ways, the contemporary configuration to which the &ldquo;occupy&rdquo; movement responds appears to demand a new thinking of politics, a politics outside the assumption of the substantial unity of identity or the shared bond of an assumed space of political identities and values, indeed a politics located outside the ambit of the Aristotelian assumption of the <em>polis,</em> the unifying center of collective thought and action directed toward the good.&nbsp; But more than just providing a radical <em>alternative</em> to the contemporary economically and administratively determined structure of the state (in the extended sense in which it comprises not only territorially based governments but also the vast trans-national economic networks that surround them and set their agendas), the &ldquo;occupy&rdquo; movement may be seen as providing some of the terms of thought and action that are most appropriate for its radical critique and transformation.&nbsp; This is because, as I shall argue in this final section, the thought and practices of the &ldquo;occupy&rdquo; movement effectively capture and bring to light the deepest and most structurally significant <em>contradictions </em>and <em>antagonisms</em> that in fact structure and determine the global politics of the market and state.</p>
<p>
	If, as I have suggested, an effective future-directed politics can no longer be thought as structured around the assumption of an organic social unity, harmonious in itself, then it becomes necessary to consider how the existing political order is in fact fundamentally structured, not by unity, but by the internal <em>divisions</em> and structural <em>contradictions</em> that threaten at each moment to rend it apart.&nbsp; From this perspective, the coercive power of the State, witnessed so spectacularly in the state violence to which &ldquo;occupy&rdquo; protestors have repeatedly been subjected, is ultimately founded not on any substantial pre-existing social bond or unity, but rather on the claim to prohibit the kind of <em>un-binding</em> that would otherwise divide the presumed unity of the state into its various constituent groups and interests.&nbsp; In his comprehensive 1988 treatise <em>Being and Event</em>, Alain Badiou offers a structurally profound and engaged theory of the possibility of fundamental political change and transformation.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/Paul/Desktop/Livingston%20-%20The%20'occupy'%20movement%20and%20the%20politics%20to%20come.doc#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"" title="""">[6]</a>&nbsp; Here, Badiou formulates a profound challenge to the classical thought of politics as founded in the unity of a social bond:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	These classical statements [of Marx, Engels, and Lenin] must be quite carefully sorted because they contain a profound idea: <em>the State is not founded upon the social bond, which it would express, but rather upon un-binding, which it prohibits</em>.&nbsp; Or, to be more precise, the separation of the State is less a result of the consistency of a presentation than of the danger of inconsistency.&nbsp; This idea goes back to Hobbes, of course (the war of all against all necessitates an absolute transcendental authority) and it is fundamentally correct in the following form: if, in a situation (historical or not), it is necessary that the parts be counted by a metastructure, it is because their excess over the terms, escaping the initial count, designates a potential place for the fixation of the void. (p. 109)</p>
<p>
	If Badiou is correct, the fundamental operation of state politics is not one of unifying individuals (for instance by means of a &ldquo;social contract&rdquo; or by appeal to the bond of mutual need) into a substantial and organic whole, but rather its effective prohibition of the un-binding of this imagined whole, the appearance of what Badiou calls its &ldquo;proper void.&rdquo;&nbsp; The state, according to Badiou, must above all else work to ward off the appearance of this void, because its appearance would signify the actual nonexistence of the substantial unity of the state, or <em>polis</em>, which the coercive functioning of state power both presumes and ideologically constructs.&nbsp; This is why, according to Badiou, any effective political action directed toward the fundamental transformation of the existing state structure must begin by staging its most important internal antagonisms and contradictions.&nbsp; What Badiou calls the &ldquo;subject&rdquo; of an &ldquo;event&rdquo; does just this: by taking account of the fundamental structural contradictions whose prohibition makes possible the existing state structure, such a &ldquo;subject&rdquo; intervenes at the precise structural points where these contradictions are most profound, thereby exposing the fiction of the unity of the existing state and creating the possibility of a transformed order to come.</p>

	From this perspective, the greatest significance of the slogan of the &ldquo;99%&rdquo; which the &ldquo;occupy&rdquo; movement has adopted is not to be found in its populism, its appeal to capture the positions or class interests of what is by far the largest socio-economic class of Americans.&nbsp; Its significance lies, rather, in&nbsp; the way that this slogan captures the <em>principal contradiction</em> that effectively structures the <em>global</em> economic-political order today <em>in its totality</em>.&nbsp; This contradiction is the one between the lives of the vast majority of citizens and consumers and those of the small minority who effectively control political decision-making and policy as a result of their control of wealth and capital.&nbsp; To recognize this contradiction as a <em>fundamental</em> antagonism is to recognize that there can be no solution to the problems of the current economic-political order on the level of incremental reforms or policy recommendations within this framework.&nbsp; Rather, what is needed is the politics of a radical staging and exposure of this fundamental contradiction, an uncompromising <em>development</em> of the fundamental antagonism to the point where it fractures the empty ideological assurances of the presumptive existing order.</p>
<p>
	Within the formal framework that Badiou proposes in <em>Being and Event</em>, this work of drawing out the structural implications of the principal, though usually suppressed, contradictions of the existing state order depends upon the retrospective recognition of what Badiou terms an &ldquo;event.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such an event is the unanticipated and unforeseeable appearance, within a constituted political order, of the possibility of the new: in its radical and sudden appearance it demonstrates what is unthinkable in the current configuration and thus makes possible the &ldquo;faithful&rdquo; action of a &ldquo;subject of the event&rdquo; in drawing out its implications and ultimately in constructing, piece by piece, a radically transformed order.&nbsp; But the action of the subject in the wake of the event is not simply to be understood, again, as providing a completely distinct articulation, simply exterior to the existing order; instead, using a highly formal apparatus of mathematical set theory, Badiou theorizes the faithful action of this subject as yielding the construction of a new situation that is &ldquo;generic&rdquo; with respect to the existing one.&nbsp; In particular, the new situation is constructed by a process of proceeding through the terms and concepts of the existing one to provide a new configuration that is precisely determined as <em>representative</em> of the totality of the old order, without, nevertheless, being <em>nameable</em> or <em>representable</em> within it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	It is in this sense, as Badiou has explained in his more recent <em>Logics of Worlds</em>, the generic activity of the subject renders visible to a &ldquo;maximal&rdquo; degree precisely those elements that were structurally invisible, though nevertheless present, within the old configuration, and so confronts the situation with its properly structuring void: adopting the Marxist motto &ldquo;we who are nothing shall be all!&rdquo; Badiou calls for the futural politics of the &ldquo;generic&rdquo;, of the sudden transformation of the situation around the unprecedented upsurge of its own most proper representative, its &ldquo;generic&rdquo; subset.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/Paul/Desktop/Livingston%20-%20The%20'occupy'%20movement%20and%20the%20politics%20to%20come.doc#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"" title="""">[7]</a></p>
<p>
	In this conception of upsurge of the &ldquo;generic&rdquo; subset that represents the totality of the situation, including most importantly its fundamentally structuring conditions, without being representable within it, we may perhaps recognize again, as well, the structure of Agamben&rsquo;s &ldquo;whatever singularity&rdquo;, the generic &ldquo;avatar&rdquo; of a community to come.&nbsp; But as we saw above, the greatest significance of the &ldquo;whatever singularity&rdquo;&nbsp; for Agamben does not lie in its potential to create a new state order, no matter how deeply transformed, but rather in its capacity to capture and embody an essential position outside the substantial unity assumed by <em>every</em> state order, to become the site of a politics that cannot be situated within any pre-existing space but rather creates itself ever anew on the basis of a fundamental opening of space and place, the spacing of the <em>kh&ocirc;ra</em>.&nbsp; Because, as I have suggested, the real importance of the gesture of &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; may ultimately lie in such a creation of spacing, Badiou&rsquo;s conception of the &ldquo;generic&rdquo; may ultimately prove more important in conceptualizing the <em>praxis</em> of the movement than does his politics of the punctual event itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In particular, as I have argued in my recent book, <em>The Politics of Logic</em>, Badiou&rsquo;s formal-structural thought of the determination of existing situations leaves open the alternative of a different, less directly militant but more critical, politics of the transformation of existing subjects and situations.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/Paul/Desktop/Livingston%20-%20The%20'occupy'%20movement%20and%20the%20politics%20to%20come.doc#_ftn8"" name=""_ftnref8"" title="""">[8]</a>&nbsp; By contrast with Badiou&rsquo;s conception, this politics does not depend centrally upon the possibility of a punctual, immediately transformative event.&nbsp; Rather, it calls for the careful construction of spaces of critique and reflection in which the fundamental antagonisms and contradictions of the existing order can be demonstrated and even pushed to the point at which they produce, of themselves, fundamental and radical change.&nbsp; As I argue in the book, the opening of these spaces can, in itself, point the way to a clarified collective life, one that does not seek ultimately to eliminate all contradiction but rather to produce forms of thought and action that comprehend and accept the necessity of strife and antagonism for all possible forms of genuine politics.&nbsp; The aim of the thought and <em>praxis</em> of such a life is not to be found in any goal of production or economy, nor (as we have seen) in any conception of a unity of essence, whether founded on nature, culture, or the common needs or rights of man.&nbsp; It is, rather, to be found only in the immanence of this life itself, in its unending and reflexive critical self-examination, and in the ongoing creation of its forms on the basis of its own self-conscious understanding of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Such a politics &ndash; what I call in the book, in opposition to Badiou&rsquo;s &ldquo;generic&rdquo; orientation, the politics of the &ldquo;paradoxico-critical&rdquo; -- does not defer the radical transformations that are clearly needed to produce a more just, egalitarian and responsible order; nor does it situate these transformations on the far side of a hypothesized &ldquo;event&rdquo; which must await the prognostication of conditions and opportunities for action.&nbsp; Rather, it actively produces these transformations <em>at each moment</em> through the creative thought and effective action that opens a new kind of space, beyond essence and unity, for the shared reflexive examination of the forms of organization and collectivity that increasingly and pervasively determine human and non-human life on Earth.&nbsp;</p>

	<strong>What is your Occupation?</strong></p>
<p>
	A talk by <em>Dr</em> <em>Miles Kennedy </em>given to Occupy Galway at 3pm on the 3<sup>rd</sup> of December 2011.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	This is a serious question, perhaps only the question of the moment, perhaps the question of the age. I ask it in earnest: What is your occupation? Of course being Irish every question is answered with a question: You might ask me, &ldquo;Who are you to ask?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What is your occupation?&rdquo;Teaching philosophy,that is my occupation, thinking is, I suppose, a pre-occupation for me, or to be more precise, I am pre-occupied by it. I am an asker of questions, who am I to ask? Another question as answer: Who else is there? As a philosopher I am, though, an outsider, I can only offer a view from outside, not outside the world, not, indeed outside the situation, there are none of us beyond that and this is precisely why the question must be asked, why it asks itself, but outside the occupation, outside the invisible walls of the camp. &nbsp;You occupy this space of action, this space is, at least from the outside, your action, though, if this is the question of the moment, then we all form part of the answer, the situation demands it. Whether resistance, collaborator or <em>attendiste</em> we are all involved, even doing nothing is doing something. What matters most is how and where one, you, I, do this nothing so I&rsquo;ll return to that primary question.</p>
<p>
	What is your occupation? You occupiers, this is asked of you, here, and in Dublin, in London, across America, and around the world, not as a question but as an answer: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get a job?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What the hell are you doing that for?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do something useful?&rdquo;. Here the Occupying activist and pre-occupied thinker share the same fate, our questions are cut short, pre-maturely answered, by other questions that are themselves answers, questions that imply their own answers: rhetorical questions. My question to you is not a rhetorical one, I really want to know: What is your occupation? As a philosopher I, like you, am asked these same questions, &ldquo;What kind of job is that?&rdquo; or even more pointedly &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get a real job?&rdquo; and sometimes I ask myself this too. &nbsp;That is why I ask the question in earnest of you, because I want to know for myself. You insiders, you occupiers, you who are within can, I hope, teach me. That is my truepreoccupation, trying to move thought from the outside to the inside, turn thought outside-in. Does any of this matter? Am I just talking about myself? The answers are less important than the question, like any good son of Socrates I ask more to hear your answer than to voice my own.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;By way of answer, for my part, all I can do is employ my own occupation, use the tools I have at hand, ply my trade, ask the basic questions of philosophy. The first has already been asked, the fundamental question is always: &ldquo;<strong>What</strong> is the right question to ask?&rdquo;. The right question is that one that asks itself, the question of the moment, whether it is significant in &ldquo;the great scheme of things&rdquo;, whether it is &ldquo;the question of the age&rdquo; cannot be answered, or even appropriately asked, <u>now</u>, as that is a question for history, a question for the future, by which time it will have been answered. The next primary question is &ldquo;<strong>How</strong> should the question be asked?&rdquo;. This too has been answered; it should be asked appropriately, in this case it should be asked in earnest. The occupation movement, as seen from the outside, is meant in earnest and cannot sufficiently be investigated or comprehended by rhetorical or ironic responses which, by answering themselves within themselves, fail to engage with the question that asks itself. So, with these primary questions both having already been asked, both having asked themselves, what is the next move, the next job of philosophy? To ask the secondary questions we have always asked but this time in regard to what emerges from these primary questions that ask themselves.I will ask, then, three interwoven secondary questions, secondary because the pressing questions of existence always precede these traditional questions of essence. These secondary questions are the three questions of <em>logos</em>: of language, logic, and life.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	On the question of language we must engage in an analysis of words. What does the word &ldquo;Occupation&rdquo; mean? We have already heard it in its most prevalent contemporary sense, its natural everyday and therefore least philosophical sense, the sense of occupation as what one does for pay, what one&rsquo;s job is. This rhetorical question, the question of &ldquo;What one does? What one is good for?&rdquo;, is answered, in large part, by the inauthentic relation of the waiter to himself as merely &ldquo;being&rdquo; a waiter (Sartre, 59), or the young woman as &ldquo;being&rdquo; only her body&rdquo; (Sartre, 55-56), each being equal to or encompassed by their external sign, their value. &nbsp;Another sense of &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; is what one does to pass the time, what one does for oneself, &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; as occupying oneself. We get a little further in terms of our primary question &ldquo;What is your occupation?&rdquo; when we move away from the rhetorical question of what one&rsquo;s job is, regardless of its answer, and into this question about life and how one chooses to pass their own time. This is a more appealing definition for you, perhaps, because it implies that the occupation of these town and city centres is directed toward occupying oneself rather than having to do with jobs or the established structure of labour economy and capital which it seeks to critique. Occupation as occupying oneself, personal occupation, then, is a step along the way to a more legitimate definition.</p>
<p>
	There is, though, yet another sense of &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; that has been all too familiar to Irish people, that is the historical sense of &ldquo;occupation&rdquo;, the sense of political or wartime occupation, the relationship between the occupied and the occupier. We here in Ireland were occupied by the forces of British Imperialism for a very long time. Irish occupiers and occupiers in Ireland can be said to have a special historical understanding and closeness with occupation and counter- occupation in the sense that Occupying British forces were first successfully confronted by a Nationalist act of counter-occupation undertaken by a materially weaker force. Due to this history Irish people have, at least on some level, assimilated this idea of counter-occupation. This is a point about the specifically Irish context of resistance but it should be noted that the British people have shared and continue to share in this history of violent occupation with us, for better or worse, and that today London too is finally being occupied by its own people.</p>
<p>
	In a more general example, though currently still very close to home, the German people have been both occupied and occupier by turns throughout their history and seem to rarely exist as a nation for any length of time without being in one or the other of these roles. Perhaps here lies the Germanic obsession with the master/slave dialectic? Which, we might ask ourselves, are they now? In this context, I see the worldwide occupy movement, rather than for example the movement toward a more unified Euro, as a reversal of how this political relationship of occupier and occupied has historically manifested itself, as an example of a kind of counter-occupation.&nbsp; So, by way of these violent historical interjections, we come some way further toward defining &ldquo;Occupation&rdquo; in a more meaningful way by recognising that it is both personal and political.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The second basic, intertwined, question of <em>logos</em> is the question of logic, here we must describe the appropriate mode of thoughtful engagement that best addresses our primary question. As with all authentic philosophy which will not satisfy itself with mere &ldquo;word games&rdquo;, questions of language and definition must lead to questions of more fundamental meaning, questions of logic. In the philosophy of situation, the philosophy that attempts to approach the world as it asks itself, the appropriate logos is phenomeno-logos, or phenomenology. In other words we employ the logic of reduction, as distinct from induction or deduction. To apply this phenomenology we must attempt to engage with the experience at hand in its most essential form, thus we must discuss occupying as encountered in its simplest lived-state, &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; as dwelling or living within.</p>
<p>
	In his 1954 essay &ldquo;&hellip; Poetically man dwells&hellip;&rdquo; the German phenomenologistMartin Heidegger went some distance toward describing this simple state of living within in his contention that to &ldquo;dwell&rdquo; authentically &ldquo;Man&rdquo; must strive to dwell poetically. &lsquo;But&hellip;&rsquo; he asked &lsquo;&hellip; how is man &ndash; and this means every man all the time &ndash; supposed to dwell poetically?&rsquo; in a situation in which</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 27pt"">
	Our dwelling is harassed by the housing shortage. Even if it were not so, our dwelling is harassed by work, made insecure by the hunt for gain or success, bewitched by the entertainment and recreation industry.&rsquo; (Heidegger, 213).</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In a way your dwelling too, your occupation, is &ldquo;harassed&rdquo; and &ldquo;made insecure&rdquo; in a very real sense because of the inherent problems of living in a public place, especially at night, and you too, it seems to me, are in fear of being &ldquo;bewitched by the entertainment and recreation industry&rdquo; that strives to make your action a TV or local-newspaper media event, perhaps presenting it with a phone-in vote to see who gets kicked out of the site this week, or, as in America a media trial to see which site gets dismantled, or as a live soap opera, or urban fashion show.</p>
<p>
	Again moving from the specific to the essential, Heidegger&rsquo;s appraisal of Modern, post-industrial, conditions of life, on first viewing, seems to hold even truer today than it did at the time of writing. &lsquo;Work&hellip; gain&hellip; success&hellip; entertainment&hellip; recreation&rsquo;, are now proposed as all embracing standards for good living the world over, as the ultimate ends of history. People fight in the streets and launch their own forms of counter-occupation in many Eastern cities and towns right now in an effort to attain access to this &ldquo;good life&rdquo;. Heidegger&rsquo;s list of what mid-twentieth century Western Man was harassed by now reads like the life-line of a flourishing post-industrial being, <strong>working</strong> hard at school in order to <strong>gain</strong> paid employment, achieving <strong>success</strong> in a chosen profession in order to afford periodic <strong>entertainment </strong>and eventually, very near the end, retiring into a much anticipated state of continual <strong>recreation</strong>.</p>
<p>
	In contrast to this work-a-day existence Heidegger proposed his version of poetical &ldquo;Dwelling&rdquo; as a more authentic mode of being-in than merely inhabiting the locations of one&rsquo;s life. Authentic, perhaps, for that time and its questions of post-war destitution and homelessness (both figurative and literal, metaphysical and concrete), but authentic for our time and our question? As hinted at previously, we can indeed see traces in the occupy movement of a kind of violent occupation, an occupation by force, intended as an act of de-familiarisation set to ignite latent anxiety and thereby bring awareness of concrete being as <em>unheimlich </em>or uncanny, and through this action, to address the question it currently asks by way of a kind of counter-occupation. Taken in this sense the Occupy movement is quite Heideggerean.</p>
<p>
	On closer inspection, though, we can detect that the questions of the early twenty-first century are considerably different to those that asked themselves in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. On the purely material level here, today, in Ireland, and in many other &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; economies, there is no housing shortage but, rather, a so-called &ldquo;over-supply&rdquo;. We are haunted by the spectre of &ldquo;ghost estates&rdquo;, a rather poetic expression in itself. On the philosophical level, Heidegger fell back into a typically German lauding of poetics due, at least in part, to a self-imposed alienation from the possibility of political discourse that resulted from his short-lived but fervent association with Nazism. While I can agree with Heidegger that a life without poetry is not a full life, for today&rsquo;s questions, the questions of a new millennium, the answer you offer in your occupation is more appropriate. Your occupation saysnot &ldquo;... poetically Man dwells...&rdquo;but &ldquo;&hellip; politically Man dwells&hellip;&rdquo;. What though is it to &ldquo;dwell politically&rdquo;? Here we uncover thelogic of occupation in its fullest sense, bringing into view the third question of logos, the question of life.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	On the question of Life, Being, or The Logos, then, we find that, in essence, &ldquo;&hellip; politically Man dwells&hellip;&rdquo;. <u>Politics</u> is derived from <em>polis </em>meaning city, a space of mass living, and also from the <em>polis </em>meaning the people, the community that live together in a particular place under the same ethos.</p>
<p>
	<u>Dwelling,</u>in its purest sense, is inhabiting, it is the mode of being in a habitat. In-habiting and habitat find both their verbal connection and their ethical sense in &ldquo;habit&rdquo; which, as Aristotle wrote, is the basis of all morality. Morality by this definition is founded on what one does, consistently and with purpose, rather than what one knows or intends. In his 1953 essay &ldquo;Building, Dwelling, Thinking&rdquo;, which was originally delivered as a lecture entitled &ldquo;Man and Space&rdquo; in 1951 (Heidegger xxiv), Heidegger distinguished between, on the one hand, &ldquo;Dwelling&rdquo; which he characterised as a human mode of existence that has the potential to reveal the nature of Being as a whole in the form of a pseudo-mystical &ldquo;four-fold&rdquo; schema, and, on the other hand &ldquo;merely inhabiting&rdquo; which, he held, does not participate in ontological revelation of this sort. The more fully formed definition of &ldquo;Occupation&rdquo; offered here adds to Heidegger&rsquo;s discourse on dwelling the possibility of ontologically revealing ethical action, thus questioning his belittlement of &ldquo;merely inhabiting&rdquo; and taking seriously the significance of habit and its moral implications for the question of dwelling. In short, then, this binding together of ethical and ontological insights is expressed in &ldquo;Occupation&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;So, political dwelling itself is found to inhabit the space of morality, and by doing this, it is hoped, it can lead to a more general re-habilitation on a moral level. This re-habilitation can only be achieved in relation to a &ldquo;habitat&rdquo;, a space in which people live, a site of co-habitation, this moral action, this ethos, must then take place in the heart of the <em>polis</em>, the city and the people. The activity of occupation is, by this account, both political and personal in nature. Occupation, and you as members of the global occupy movement, are the living expression of this new comprehension of the essential condition in which &ldquo;&hellip; politically Man dwells&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>
	Perhaps on another occasion I can discuss with you the merits and de-merits of using this term &ldquo;Man&rdquo; as synonymous with &ldquo;human-being&rdquo;, particularly from the point of view of gender difference, but that is not the central concern for now.</p>
<p>
	The point here is that &ldquo;Occupation&rdquo;, as a mode of political dwelling brings before us an expression of &lsquo;the basic character of human existence&rsquo; (Heidegger, 215) thus opening the possibility of approaching the question of Being through a different but equally fundamental direction than that which Heidegger chose: the direction of ethical space. Occupying this ethical space is an authentic mode of being-within, a mode of dwelling inside a space with others, co-habiting in a world of spatially related beings and, most fundamentally, authentically grasping ourselves as beings which are themselves spaces.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Conclusion: through the discussion of these three secondary questions we have come, finally, to the third, and most often overlooked, of our primary questions, not &ldquo;<u>What</u> is the right question?&rdquo; or &ldquo;<u>How</u> should the question be asked?&rdquo; but a different kind of primary question &ldquo;Is the question <u>right</u>?&rdquo;. This ultimate question is the question of ethos, or how to live well. Inauthentic being, we have found, is, first of all, being-in the they-self of occupations that encompass and answer the most rhetorical and therefore least meaningful question of occupation. Any form of life that renders a human being into a mere quantity, a standing reserve, to be tapped and used up when required; any form of being which makes human life a numerical sum; any system which only asks the questions of economy, or attempts to create an economical form of life generating questions to be answered always with 1, what 1 does, how 1 should act, what good 1 is, and in which when that 1 is gone or used up or deigned surplus to requirement it is simply replaced by another 1 or perhaps not even replaced by another 1; any system of this sort is inauthentic and breeds inauthenticity within itself, and ourselves.</p>
<p>
	Anxiety at this age old situation of simply being 1, doing what 1 does, is ever present and has been offered, notably by Heidegger, as a revelatory experience gesturing toward a more authentic logic of occupation as &ldquo;Dwelling&rdquo;. However, this lauding of anxiety accepts the state of affairs from which the anxiety emerges as it is and does not question the fundamental, forward driven, temporally determined, and implemental structure in which humanity purportedly &ldquo;always already&rdquo; finds itself, in which, in other words, 1 is 1.</p>
<p>
	You are doing what one does not do, you are living in a park, occupying a city, being your own message. You are dwelling politically. An analysis of this mode of Being-within has been offered here as an appropriate conception of the type of occupation that attempts to answer the current question, to speak Being as it presents itself. But this conception too is lacking in the full meaning of your occupation, this too fails to encompass your occupation, because your occupation is an expression of another question of philosophy: the question of ethics. Your occupation asks the question of right and wrong, good and evil. Your occupation is clearly not merely falling in with the they-self, it is not merely something one does, though it is something you are doing; nor is it just a statement of more authentic &ldquo;Dwelling&rdquo;, it is not just an engaged act of Heideggerean de-familiarisation perpetrated on &ldquo;the other&rdquo; in order to violently wake them from &ldquo;false consciousness&rdquo;, though it is that too; it is not even &ldquo;only&rdquo; a fundamental act of being-within, an acknowledgement of the primordial human relation to each other through co-habiting the same place, this world; it is also, above all of those, a fundamentally ethical activity. Yes in a sense you are &ldquo;just doing your thing&rdquo;, you are &ldquo;just here&rdquo;, you are merely being &ldquo;in the world&rdquo; but it is the location of that &lsquo;just being&rsquo;, the situation within the situation, the site of occupation, that acts as a call of conscience. Ethics is based on habitual occupation, good habits, what you do not what you know, habit, habitat and habitation, how you in-habit your own space, how you occupy yourself, only this opens up the possibility of a more general re-habilitation. What you are doing is more than mere doing, more even than authentic dwelling, perhaps, just perhaps more even than Being, you are occupying.</p>
<p>
	In conclusion, it has been my intention to ask you to ask yourselves &ldquo;What is your Occupation?&rdquo;, the tentative answers I have offered from the outside are, put negatively, to paraphrase a great poet of the 21<sup>st</sup> century:</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 36pt"">
	You are not your job, you&rsquo;re not how much money you have in the bank.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 36pt"">
	You&rsquo;re not the car you drive.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 36pt"">
	You are not the contents of your wallet.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Or, put positively:</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	You are your own occupation;</p>
<p>
	your own core project;</p>
<p>
	your own basic task.</p>
<p>
	You are your own location;</p>
<p>
	your own first space.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 36pt"">
	You are what we ought to be, your own engaged, political and ethical activity.</p>
<p>
	You are both the mode and the means of this occupation;</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 36pt"">
	you bring into view for the rest of us a fundamental expression of the basic character of human existence:</p>
<p>
	freedom.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	To end on a personal note, I say this to you in earnest and I hope it makes you feel good, you should feel good because you are good. I hope that these few words and observations give you a particular kind of good feeling, that they make you feel warm inside and &lsquo;full of merit&rsquo; and that this warmth can, in some small way, sustain you in your efforts. Given the attacks and dismantling of Occupy sites across America, you must remember the most fundamental, meaning of &ldquo;Occupation&rdquo;, to occupy means &lsquo;to remain, to stay in place&rsquo; (Heidegger 148), on that note I leave you with three winter wishes:</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Stay warm,</p>
<p>
	Stay safe,</p>
<p>
	Stay here.</p>
<p>

<p>
	Thank you.</p>

	<u>The Nonviolent 99</u></p>
<p>
	The Occupy Movement has renewed one of the long-standing debates among people concerned with making the world more just: What is the proper role of violence in human liberation? Beginning with the post-Enlightenment Age of Revolutions up through today&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;more radical&rdquo; elements of the anarchist and environmental movements, people have long held that some measure of violence is necessary to destroy the present order and prepare the way for something better. Recommendations for violence range from beginning an all out war of the masses against corrupt and unjust governments, to using violence as a means of defending protestors against the police and the army, to spearheading small-scale actions that only the widest definition of violence registers, such as the destruction of corporate property. Violence is understood as a useful means for obtaining freedom for a wide variety of reasons. For instance, violence can draw attention and rally people to one&rsquo;s cause, offer a powerful symbolic challenge to the extant authorities and, quite literally, initiate the demolition of the current system.</p>
<p>
	Much has already been written to refute the usefulness of violence for the Occupy Movement,<a href=""#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1"" title="""">[i]</a> but less has been said about Occupy&rsquo;s relationship to previous and ongoing liberation movements. Although Occupy has already shown itself to be unique in important ways, we might also think about the movement through the lens of two related, but distinguishable, liberation traditions. The liberation tradition that began with the American and French Revolutions suggests that violence and co-opting the violent means of those currently in control is the best route to freedom. The liberation tradition that began with the mid-nineteenth century abolitionists involves exercising political power through nonviolence in permanent opposition to authority that is economically and politically privileged.</p>
<p>
	Although communists and other advocates of violent revolution often associate nonviolence with bourgeois timidity, the historical fact is that the idea that violence is necessary for the pursuit of human freedom was born in the bourgeois revolutions in America and France. Jefferson, Paine, Lafayette, Robespierre and Bolivar may have disagreed about when and how much violence to use, but they all agreed that some measure of violence was necessary for founding republics and overthrowing the aristocracy. Socialist revolutionaries applied these ideas to the bourgeois orders. Like their bourgeois forebears, Marx, Trotsky, Lenin, Bakunin and Kropotkin, disagreed about when and how to use violence. In a split mirroring the differences between libertarians like Jefferson and ardent federalists like Hamilton, anarchists and communists disputed whether or not a strong centralized government could be used for good. Marx eventually led the expulsion of the anarchists from the International, in part with a campaign that called into question Bakunin&rsquo;s masculinity by associating his unwillingness to endorse the violence of the state with a gay relationship.<a href=""#_edn2"" name=""_ednref2"" title="""">[ii]</a> However, the bourgeois idea that violence was necessary to overthrow an old order and institute a new order and that violence was an expression of and a precursor to human freedom was adopted by all of the pro-violence socialists.</p>
<p>
	In the mid-nineteenth century, the American and British abolitionist movement pioneered an idea they called &ldquo;nonresistance&rdquo; &ndash; a term that the Unitarian minister Adin Ballou immediately saw was lacking because the activity actually involved the &ldquo;highest&rdquo; resistance to injustice.<a href=""#_edn3"" name=""_ednref3"" title="""">[iii]</a> What was intended by the term, as William Lloyd Garrison understood it, was that the abolitionists would pursue human liberation with equal vigor but different methods than their forefathers &ndash; who after all had enshrined slavery in the U.S. Constitution with the 3/5ths clause.<a href=""#_edn4"" name=""_ednref4"" title="""">[iv]</a> Through a wide variety of techniques, including the creation of the Underground Railroad to assist and encourage runaways, boycotts of slave-made products, demonstrations, international conventions and the formation of political parties, abolitionists around the world set about dismantling an institution. These techniques were taken up by a second nonviolent movement born of the abolitionist cause: the struggle for women&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>
	A recent empirical study of revolutions in the twentieth century shows that nonviolent political revolutions tend to be more successful in overthrowing autocrats and generally lead to more democratic governments after the revolution.<a href=""#_edn5"" name=""_ednref5"" title="""">[v]</a> But even this impressive evidence misses the longer historical trajectory of liberation movements. In only one case in all of recorded history has a violent slave rebellion successfully led to freedom, the remarkable Haitian Revolution led by Toussaint Louverture at end of the eighteenth century.<a href=""#_edn6"" name=""_ednref6"" title="""">[vi]</a> There has never been a large-scale violent revolution by women against a male-run government. Yet the abolitionist and women&rsquo;s movements have achieved extraordinary success. How is this possible? Through educating people and organizing mass political action over the course of many decades. For time immemorial people, including many women and slaves themselves, understood slavery to be natural and beneficial and the status of women to be naturally and inevitably second class. In addition, vicious and endemic violence is part and parcel of patriarchal orders and slave systems. Indeed, men and slave owners have invariably reacted to feminists and abolitionists with violence. Yet through the mobilization of nonviolent power, abolitionists ended legally sanctioned slavery in every country in the world.<a href=""#_edn7"" name=""_ednref7"" title="""">[vii]</a> They did this in the face of the most lucrative slave system the world has ever known. Although there is still much work to do, feminists have gained political and economic rights for millions of women around the world. Indeed, feminism holds out the hope of liberating half of humanity.</p>
<p>
	Taking the long view, the last couple centuries show that nonviolence has achieved much more in the way of human liberation than violence. As impressive as the American and French Revolutions were, Jefferson, Paine, Lafayette and Robespierre contested the authority of a small number of white male aristocrats in order to secure the political and economic liberties of a larger number of white men &ndash; often for the purpose of allowing them to keep slaves and dominate native peoples. The Haitian Revolution freed the slaves of a single country from whites, but even this victory was somewhat pyrrhic as Louverture forced many former slaves back onto plantations in their new position as &ldquo;cultivators.&rdquo;<a href=""#_edn8"" name=""_ednref8"" title="""">[viii]</a></p>
<p>
	Violent revolutions were no doubt accompanied by important ideas, but it was left to others to actually fulfill the promise of those ideas with painstaking organizing, political mobilization and educational efforts. Take, for instance, the American Civil War. While many of the abolitionists who had previously been committed to nonviolence ended up supporting John Brown and then the Union cause, the results of the war were less clear. If the Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth and Fourteen Amendments held great promise, in practice the violence unleashed by the war was understood by subsequent generations of racists in the South and Midwest as justifying further violence. The war also resulted in the split among abolitionists and women&rsquo;s rights advocates over the use of the word &ldquo;male&rdquo; in the new amendments and &ndash; of direct relevance to the Occupy movement &ndash; the establishment of &ldquo;rights&rdquo; for corporations. It was left to Dr. King and the Civil Rights Movement, mobilizing people with direct nonviolent action against the forces of violence, to revive the work of gaining real political and economic freedom for African Americans.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The plight of working people has been caught in the middle of this centuries long debate about violence. Many communist revolutions involved the violent overthrow of governments and many labor activists and socialists foreswore violence in favor of strikes and other forms of nonviolent resistance. The European revolutions of 1848 perhaps sit somewhere in between. We should also not overlook the fact that economic freedom is inseparable from political freedom when we consider abolition and feminism.</p>
<p>
	So where does the Occupy movement stand in relation to this history?</p>
<p>
	The invocation of the very phrase &ldquo;the 99 percent&rdquo; seems to favor the use of nonviolence over the use of violence. A claim to speak for and represent the interests of 99 percent of people sets the bar extremely high for Occupy. It is both a powerful meme and a challenge. It suggests that the movement will offer ideas, policies and models of governance that are so consistent with common sense and so broadly aim to serve the public good, that they will appeal to 99 percent of people in the United States (and around the world?). If this is to be more than a slogan, it requires drawing in everyone from the far left to ardent Tea Party activists and everyone from the very well to do to the homeless. It requires a monumental organizing and educational effort. 99 percent of people do not currently understand or find troublesome the idea that corporations hold many of the same rights and privileges they do. But it is a legal doctrine that undoubtedly, in fact, does harm in various ways and to various degrees the interests of 99 percent of the people in the United States. Occupy aims for an epochal change in our way of thinking about the role of corporations in democratic societies. It works for a day when the idea that for-profit corporations are wholly subservient to the public interest is as commonplace as our commitment to women&rsquo;s rights and our moral repulsion to slavery.</p>
<p>
	Recently, governments have ramped up their suppression of the Occupy movement. Their lack of restraint is an opportunity, unless people are convinced such violence is justified. Police violence requires that the 99 percent believe their actions are legitimate and serve the common good. The primary justification for police violence that the 99 will find convincing is that Occupy started it by destroying property or threatening the police. Clear statements by General Assemblies regarding nonviolence and techniques for confronting fringe elements within the movement are critical in this regard.<a href=""#_edn9"" name=""_ednref9"" title="""">[ix]</a></p>
<p>
	Looking out for the interests of the 99 percent almost necessarily excludes the use of violence as a political tool. One would have to imagine that an Occupy vanguard could effectively use violence to convince 99 percent of the people of broad, common sense truths. But it is hard to see how breaking windows and provoking police educates people &ndash; and it is easy to see how even self-defense, while sometimes justified, is quickly transformed by authorities into an excuse.<a href=""#_edn10"" name=""_ednref10"" title="""">[x]</a> The advocates of violence think headlines will help the cause, but the hard work of helping people understand the complex and often surreptitious ways in which their lives are affected by the oversized influence of corporations requires thoughtful, organized engagement and active resistance that exposes specific problems.<a href=""#_edn11"" name=""_ednref11"" title="""">[xi]</a> In developing countries the dynamics of exploitation are often more obvious, where people are displaced and exploited by corporations in an egregious fashion with the assistance of police states. But these same factors make educating people and organizing for resistance in such places more difficult.</p>
<p>
	If the Occupy movement can unfold the truth that the undue influence of corporations damages working people, middle management, the planet, small businesses and family farms, it will prevail. The great insight of the political theory of strategic nonviolence is that power does not come <em>from</em> people, or rely <em>upon</em> people but that it simply <em>is</em> people &ndash; acting in concert with one another.<a href=""#_edn12"" name=""_ednref12"" title="""">[xii]</a> What this means is that a movement that aims to serve the interests of 99 percent of people does not <em>need</em> violence. This is the basic truth that those who criticize nonviolence, such as Peter Gelderloos and Ward Churchill, and those who romanticize and celebrate violence, such as Slavoj Zizek, fail to understand.<a href=""#_edn13"" name=""_ednref13"" title="""">[xiii]</a> 99 percent of people cannot be conquered by way of the violence of the 1 percent of people if they understand their interests and are politically engaged, which is the very aim of the Occupy movement. What makes the 1 percent powerful are highly coordinated efforts both with one another to influence government and with some portion of the 99 who are swayed by certain ideas, threats and incentives. In a very direct way, fighting the 1 percent with violence is in fact fighting co-opted portions of the 99 with violence. The police are part of the 99 percent &ndash; just ask them how they have faired with slashed state and local budgets. Likewise, violence is not required for governing and restraining the 1 percent if 99 percent of people are made aware of their common interests. When people understand the fact that 1 percent of us are making off with our economic and planetary future, when the 1 percent is no longer able to sway some portion of the 99 percent, they simply will not be able to rule.</p>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; that followed The Civil War was characterized by westward expansion combined with a massive industrial extension made possible by new technologies like the gasoline engine and the increased mechanization of industries such as steel, textiles, farming and mining.&nbsp; During &lsquo;The Gilded Age,&rsquo; names that Americans still celebrate as folk heroes such as Carnegie, Mellon, Morgan, Rockefeller and Vanderbilt amassed fortunes on a scale never thought possible by taking advantage of these new economic opportunities.&nbsp; However, there is a controversial side to many of these men mostly forgotten to history.&nbsp; When Americans celebrate Gilded Age elites as exemplars of American Individualism, we often forget in their own time they were called <em>robber barons.&nbsp; </em>This derogatory phrase refers to the ways many industrialists maintained an aristocratic-like status in society through amoral and often illegal business practices that allowed their fortunes to grow at the expense of the greater social good.&nbsp; In fact, Mark Twain named this period &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; to metaphorically describe how these few, immensely successful individuals and their opulent lifestyle as gilding our society, or as putting a thin layer of gold over an object to conceal the ugliness beneath. &nbsp;Just beneath the golden surface of &lsquo;The Gilded Age,&rsquo; most workers suffered in poverty despite working inordinate numbers of hours at difficult and often dangerous industrial or agricultural jobs.&nbsp; In fact, exploitation of these workers is a larger reason why robber barons were able to amass vast fortunes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inequalities beneath the surface of &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; fa&ccedil;ade resulted in economic and political practices that concentrated not just wealth but also power in the hands of robber barons.&nbsp; Political corruption was widespread during &lsquo;The Gilded Age,&rsquo; which enabled robber barons to both rig economic rules to their favor or avoid culpability for their behaviors that went beyond moral and crossed legal lines.&nbsp; A famous and fitting example considering Twain&rsquo;s gilding metaphor occurred when the railroad baron Jay Gould used his political connections to create inflation by manipulating the availability of gold, which then forced commodity traders to import goods like wheat from western markets to increase supply&mdash;commodities that had to be moved at inordinate rates on Gould&rsquo;s trains.&nbsp; While the Grant administration ultimately foiled the plan, Gould&rsquo;s manipulations were the root cause of the Black Friday stock market crash of 1869.&nbsp; Because of his political connections, Gould was never charged with any crime.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn10"" name=""_ednref10"" title="""">[10]</a></sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn10"" name=""_ednref10"" title=""""></a>&nbsp; Practices like this were quite common as robber barons drew upon their power and oligopolistic control over the economy to maximize their gains in ways that often came at the expense of less powerful others and the economy as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there was some progressive pushback in the early 1900s, and we generally ignored inequalities during &lsquo;The First Great War&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Roaring 20s,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; not only lasted until the late 1920s, but the inequalities and corrosive economic practices of the age largely caused &lsquo;The Great Depression.&rsquo;&nbsp; Following World War I, an increasing amount of capital flooded the investment market from small investors, many of whom bought &ldquo;on margin&rdquo; or borrowed the money to invest in the market in the hopes that return rates would outpace interest payments.&nbsp; Financiers then used others&rsquo; borrowed capital to enhance their own investments by taking advantage of the inflated prices that came from over demand.&nbsp; But on Black Thursday in 1929, it was suddenly apparent the inflated value of stocks could no longer be maintained and the stock market crashed.&nbsp; The subsequent run on the banks meant even those who did not gamble on Wall Street lost their savings alongside the investors when their many banks shut their doors.&nbsp; Businesses large and small collapsed from a lack of consumer demand, and overall lack of both capital and credit for investment meant stagnation persisted.&nbsp; The effects of the subsequent depression were widespread, which meant loss and suffering were distributed across the social classes, as often those who had the most at the end of &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; lost the most.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were a great many historical parallels between the dawn of the 21<sup>st</sup> century and &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; we ignored much to our peril.&nbsp; Both gilded ages followed protracted periods of war which, when ended, opened up new markets.&nbsp; The end of The Civil War was followed by massive westward expansion that stalled even before the outbreak of fighting because of political stagnation.&nbsp; Similarly, the fall of the Soviet Union in 1992 had the same effect of the fall of the U.S. Confederacy as the end of open hostilities opened up markets all across the globe.&nbsp; Furthermore, just like the technologies developed during the Civil War propelled production across many peacetime industries, the computer technologies developed during the Cold War were unleashed by the fall of Communism and made globalization happen at both an astonishing rate and on a scale never thought possible.&nbsp; Similar to the first Gilded Age, expanding markets and new technologies provided increasing opportunities for entrepreneurs to introduce new products and amass great fortunes.&nbsp; &nbsp;The financial industry was quick to capitalize both on technology to improve communications and trade so they could take full advantage of these entrepreneurs&rsquo; innovations.&nbsp; Also like the first Gilded Age elites used their wealth and power to both game the system, many in the financial sector compelled politicians to undo regulations put in place after the 1929 Wall Street crash and to avoid punishment for their amoral and sometimes illegal market practices.&nbsp; Furthermore, just as in 1929, an inflated and over-leveraged market quickly and abruptly corrected itself and there was a massive drop in the markets that began on September 29<sup>th</sup> of 2008.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at this point the historical trajectory diverges and the times become distinct from one another.&nbsp; In 1929, the very same laissez-faire policies of the Hoover administration that allowed problematic trading practices and an expansion of inequalities meant the state allowed the invisible hand of the market to correct itself with detrimental costs.&nbsp; This is not what happened in 2008, as free-marketers pressured the federal government to institute their actual economic belief; profits should be privatized, while losses should be socialized.&nbsp; In 2008, the new robber barons or &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; used their power and forced the passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act that saved large banks and the companies that insured them; although it should be noted these &ldquo;banks&rdquo; are better described as investment houses because they do little to safeguard money for individuals in their pursuit of profit through the markets.&nbsp; However, calling them banks reinforces the narrative that what we faced as a nation was another great depression, thus &lsquo;the banks&rsquo; were saved because history taught us The Hoover administration&rsquo;s failure to act quickly in 1929 further entrenched economic stagnation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, even though both market crashes in our history were followed by periods of economic recession and stagnation, &ldquo;The (Investment) Bank Bailout&rdquo; as it is now called is one of many economic policies that vastly altered the unfolding of supposedly free market practices.&nbsp; In his 2010 State of the Union Address, President Obama proudly declared&hellip;</p>
<p class=""rteindent1"">
	One year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by a severe recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, and a government deeply in debt.&nbsp; Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act, we might face a second depression.&nbsp; So we acted -&ndash; immediately and aggressively.&nbsp; And one year later, the worst of the storm has passed.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn17"" name=""_ednref17"" title="""">[17]</a></sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn17"" name=""_ednref17"" title=""""></a></p>
<p>
	Technically, this statement is likely correct as &lsquo;The (Investment) Bank Bailout&rsquo; did likely stave off further economic turmoil that could have stagnated economic growth for decades that characterized &lsquo;The Great Depression.&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, what is left unsaid in these remarks is that in staving off depression, this and other policies like &lsquo;The Stimulus Plan&rsquo; that primarily consisted of tax breaks for corporations; the federal government continued &lsquo;The New Gilded Age.&rsquo;&nbsp; By essentially allowing the new robber barons to embezzle tax dollars with no strings attached, the federal government perpetuated Gilded Age economic practices and made the different social classes experience the downturn in vastly different ways.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn18"" name=""_ednref18"" title="""">[18]</a></sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn18"" name=""_ednref18"" title=""""></a>&nbsp; The 99% lost a large proportion of their investments and continues to suffer from the economic downturn.&nbsp; While there was very brief talk of the super-rich&rsquo;s demise with the start of the downturn, since then &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; has fared quite well through &lsquo;The Great Recession.&rsquo;<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn19"" name=""_ednref19"" title="""">[19]</a>,<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn20"" name=""_ednref20"" title="""">[20]</a></sup>&nbsp;While technically most individuals (e.g. upwards of 99%) are suffering as they did during &lsquo;The Great Depression,&rsquo; in terms of inequality we have never put &lsquo;The New Gilded Age&rsquo; behind us because an elite few continue to prosper in ways that are historically unprecedented.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn21"" name=""_ednref21"" title=""""><sup>[21]</sup></a><sup>&nbsp; </sup>However, so long as a vast majority of citizens presume there is widespread economic hardship as there was in during &lsquo;The Great Depression,&rsquo; the prosperity of &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; that is occurring at the expense of &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo; goes mostly unnoticed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Resuming the New Gilded Age</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States never really moved away from &lsquo;The New Gilded Age&rsquo; as inequality persists despite the great deal of turmoil in the investment markets right before the elections of 2008.&nbsp; Yet, the turmoil itself did instill a narrative that our own economic time is similar to &lsquo;The Great Depression&rsquo; given the memories of the 1929 stock market crash that affected everyone.&nbsp; Yet in 1929, the crash often meant those who had the most were the ones who lost the most while, in our own time, policies like &lsquo;The (Investment) Bank Bailout&rsquo; redirected history and, despite popular misconceptions about widespread suffering at the top of the class hierarchy, those who had and have the least are now suffering the most.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn22"" name=""_ednref22"" title="""">[22]</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the risk of morbidity, a simple example illustrates the divergence between these two periods.&nbsp;&nbsp; We likely heard stories about Wall Street bankers throwing themselves from buildings during the 1929 crash and subsequent depression; this type of death was even used as the just end to the villain in the movie Titanic, one of the highest grossing films of all time.&nbsp; While perhaps more folklore than fact, there are not even rumors of this happening in the 2008 crash and subsequent recession; and why would stories like this emerge given that Wall Street investors are doing better than ever?<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn23"" name=""_ednref23"" title="""">[23]</a>&nbsp;</sup> Instead we read about Chinese workers at an Apple electronic factory installing nets to catch suicide jumpers while we posthumously celebrate Steve Jobs as the quintessential industrialist or technologist of our own Gilded Age.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn24"" name=""_ednref24"" title="""">[24]</a>,<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn25"" name=""_ednref25"" title="""">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recent examples of how &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; uses their power to ensure prosperity at the expense of &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo; are both plentiful and reinforce how our contemporary economy is more comparable to &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; than &lsquo;The Great Recession.&rsquo; &nbsp;Furthermore, many of these examples also highlight how &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; avoid civil and legal liability for their amoral, if not illegal practices while ensuring &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo; are not only shamed, but also held legally responsible for their mistakes.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn26"" name=""_ednref26"" title="""">[26]</a>&nbsp;</sup> While many of &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo; who unknowingly bought over-valued homes with the promise of pursuing the American Dream are now under-water and fighting to stay off homelessness, the biggest mortgage defaulters are on &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo;s&rsquo; second homes.&nbsp; While the Justice Department is willing to give banks and mortgage services immunity for illegally foreclosing upon homeowners in the robo-signing scandal so long as they pay a minor fine, we also see the return of debtors&rsquo; prisons for &lsquo;The 99%.&rsquo;&nbsp; The one supposedly populist aspect of the Troubled Asset Relief Program designed to help homeowners in financial trouble avoid foreclosure was so abused by mortgage providers and services the program was discontinued; no one was ever held accountable for abusing this program while individuals who trusted the system lost everything they invested in their homes.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn27"" name=""_ednref27"" title="""">[27]</a></sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn27"" name=""_ednref27"" title=""""></a>&nbsp; While taxpayers bailed out &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; with no strings attached by the federal government, they adamantly fight proposals to reduce either principle or interest rates for homeowners and student debtors because such a program would result in a short-term loss in the value of their securities&mdash;even though it might save money in the long-term by avoiding future defaults and foreclosures.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn28"" name=""_ednref28"" title="""">[28]</a></sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn28"" name=""_ednref28"" title=""""></a>&nbsp; This in no way resembles &lsquo;The Great Depression&rsquo; when those with the most lost the most and ultimately everyone suffered somewhat equally.&nbsp; Rather, it is reminiscent of &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; when robber barons would easily fend off antitrust suits for decades on end while they continuously and constantly hauled their less powerful competitors, journalists willing to write the truth, and union leaders in front of bought judges under trumped up charges.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, much like the first gilded age where robber barons felt confident to do as they please without consequences, today &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; can both metaphorically and literally consider themselves above the law.&nbsp; The arrogance of &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; as indicated by things like their disregard of public opinion as they write themselves record high bonuses while they lay off workers is indicative of their confidence they can continue to block investigations into their wrongdoings.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn29"" name=""_ednref29"" title="""">[29]</a>&nbsp;</sup>Instead, they watch the police arrest occupiers in nighttime commando raids from opulent offices and apartments in their ivory towers above.&nbsp; And of course evicting people from these public spaces, many of whom turned to occupy camps because they had no place left to go, in no way resemble the &lsquo;Hooverville&rsquo; shanty-towns that became the symbols of &lsquo;The Great Depression.&rsquo;&nbsp; Rather, these raids remind us of &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; when robber barons, safe in their Victorian Mansions, would pay state and private militias like the Pinkertons to throw workers out of company-owned houses and violently break up peaceful strikes with egregious over-uses of force.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Consequences of Seeing the New Gilded Age as the Great Recession&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We tend to live in reality as we see it, not as it actually is,<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn30"" name=""_ednref30"" title="""">[30]</a></sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn30"" name=""_ednref30"" title=""""></a>and thus there are important consequences when we misconstrue our contemporary economic reality with &lsquo;The Great Depression.&rsquo;&nbsp; One peculiar aspect about our retrospective assessment of &lsquo;The Great Depression&rsquo; is how the period is now often looked at with a certain degree of nostalgia, or as one of the great triumphs of our society.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn31"" name=""_ednref31"" title="""">[31]</a></sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn31"" name=""_ednref31"" title=""""></a>&nbsp; For example, there is a framing how prior to winning &lsquo;The Second Great War,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Greatest Generation&rsquo; used their tenacity, ingenuity and fortitude to first survive and then overcome &lsquo;The Great Depression.&rsquo;<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn32"" name=""_ednref32"" title="""">[32]</a>&nbsp;</sup> Thus, we tend to overlook the widespread suffering and political turmoil of this time and instead focus on how a country first survived and then overcame &lsquo;The Great Depression&rsquo; by first sacrificing and then pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we compare our own time to &lsquo;The Great Depression,&rsquo; it makes us think there is a great deal of suffering amongst all the social classes, while also reinforcing arguments the way to overcome our economic challenges is to work harder than we ever have before while sacrificing everything we can do without.&nbsp; Of course, suffering is not evenly distributed across the classes as &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo; bear the brunt of our hardships while &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; continues to prosper.&nbsp; Furthermore, &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; are doing so well in large part because &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo; devote themselves to working harder and harder for the greater social good.&nbsp; Many Americans are now more educated (often at great financial cost to ourselves) and productive than ever; yet wages have been stagnant for a generation and are now actually starting to decline, especially when we factor in inflation and increased costs of living.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn33"" name=""_ednref33"" title="""">[33]</a>&nbsp;</sup> Thus, under a guise of shared struggle, &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; uses the promise of better times ahead to convince &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo; what is needed now is for us to sacrifice everything we do not need and to work harder and harder for less income that increasingly provides a lower and lower standard of living.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn34"" name=""_ednref34"" title="""">[34]</a>,<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn35"" name=""_ednref35"" title="""">[35]</a>,<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn36"" name=""_ednref36"" title="""">[36]</a></sup>&nbsp; Of course, these practices are much more akin to &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; where workers were all but forced by gunpoint to toil for low wages than &lsquo;The Great Depression&rsquo; where economic stagnation existed because individuals could not find jobs and could not contribute to the greater social good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also important to recognize that, similar to &lsquo;The Great Depression,&rsquo; blame for the economic crisis is falsely spread away from Gilded Age economic elites and toward victims of circumstance.&nbsp; History textbooks emphasize how &lsquo;small investors buying on margin&rsquo; were a major cause of the 1929 stock market crash.&nbsp; While widespread borrowing to invest was a problem, it occurred primarily because those in the financial industry knew they could make money without risking their own capital.&nbsp; This created a situation where financiers could gamble in a game with only two outcomes; &ldquo;tails they win, heads we lose.&rdquo;&nbsp; Today, &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; is already rewriting recent history to read in a similar way.<sup>[<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn37"" name=""_ednref37"" title="""">37]</a></sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn37"" name=""_ednref37"" title=""""></a>&nbsp; Turn on any business cable news channel or pick up the Wall Street Journal and inevitably you will find arguments that ignore the reckless investments of elites and instead blames 99%ers for taking on the very same levels of debt they encouraged for the better part of a generation. <sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn38"" name=""_ednref38"" title="""">[38]</a></sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn38"" name=""_ednref38"" title=""""></a>&nbsp; For example, &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; blames &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo; for over-using their credit cards to buy frivolous lifestyle items, although investigations show a significant portion of the debts owed come from fees and inordinate interest rates charged by lenders.{<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn39"" name=""_ednref39"" title="""">39]</a>&nbsp;</sup> Since the 2008 crisis was primarily a result of the mortgage morass, it is also common for The 1% to argue homeowners irresponsibly bought homes they could not afford, thus essentially calling The 99% too stupid to understand the risks they undertook despite overwhelming evidence realtors steered their customers towards homes they could not afford to heighten their commission while mortgage providers carelessly, if not intentionally, overlooked mistakes in applications&mdash;likely because they knew the mortgage would be sold to investors who would take the loss if the loans defaulted.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn40"" name=""_ednref40"" title="""">[40]</a>&nbsp; Defying logic, &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; still hold fast to these arguments while continuing to oppose the Consumer Protection Bureau<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn41"" name=""_ednref41"" title="""">[41]</a>even though it might help stop the supposedly &lsquo;consumer stupidity&rsquo; they argue caused the 2008 crash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; have a vested interest in convincing the country we are fighting off another great depression rather than recognizing we are living in a second gilded age.&nbsp; While it would be impossible to ever establish this framing of our socio-economic conditions is a concerted effort by &lsquo;The 1%,&rsquo; there are obviously benefits when the majority of &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo;are unaware how similar our time is to one of the most egregiously exploitative periods in our history.&nbsp; This is because there would be a great deal more resistance to the status quo and a desire for change when we properly recognize the economic organization and problems we confront are much more similar to &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; than &lsquo;The Great Depression.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Fighting the Wrong Battles</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part of living in the reality we see as opposed to recognizing reality as it actually exists means our efforts are often directed at the issues we see as problematic as opposed to seeking solutions to the troubles that actually ail us.&nbsp; In short, because we do not recognize the problems we face today are more akin to what the United States confronted during The Gilded Age, our efforts to combat economic recession and stagnation are doomed to fail because the actual problems we face as a nation stem from inequality.&nbsp; Specifically, the primary issues confronting the United States are the concentration of wealth of &lsquo;The 1%,&rsquo; which according to zero-sum economic theories is only possible during slow economic growth when it comes at the expense of &lsquo;The 99%.&rsquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thus, because we incorrectly perceive the socio-economic organization of today akin to &lsquo;The Great Depression,&rsquo; we tend to draw upon a select subset of New Deal policies and programs FDR used to overcome the first great economic stagnation our country faced that had inherently different root causes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was brief talk of action on inequality immediately after the 2008 presidential election, but this was more fiction than fact as Obama&rsquo;s first two signature pieces of legislation did more for &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; than &lsquo;The 99%.&rsquo;&nbsp; The stimulus package consisted primarily of tax cuts to benefit businesses.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn42"" name=""_ednref42"" title="""">[42]</a>&nbsp; While Obama&rsquo;s health care reform bill does include rules that make patients less vulnerable to their insurance companies, it mostly funnels capital into for-profit, publically traded corporations because it does not contain the public option he campaigned on.&nbsp; Furthermore, inequality was quickly abandoned as a rationale for these efforts, as even the health care legislation was supported with arguments that it would be good for the economy&mdash;a framing that served to further reinforce perceptions we are stuck in another great depression as oppose to a second gilded age.</p>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The election of a Republican congress in 2010 meant even talk of inequalities were dismissed as &lsquo;class warfare.&rsquo;&nbsp; The 112<sup>th</sup> congress focused the political discussion almost exclusively on government spending, often by comparing our own time to &lsquo;The Great Depression&rsquo; to instill a sense that sacrifices needed to be made.&nbsp; By insisting the government had a &ldquo;spending&rdquo; problem as opposed to a &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; problem, a crusade was launched against&nbsp; New Deal and Great Society programs like Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and Food Stamps that alleviate inequality.&nbsp; Forms of corporate welfare and military spending that benefit primarily &lsquo;The1%&rsquo; were not a part of the discussion.&nbsp; Furthermore, arguments about a more progressive tax code were quickly shut down as &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; argued taking anything away from the &lsquo;job creators&rsquo; would stall the very recovery &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; argue was not happening because of government spending.&nbsp; Thus, by perceiving the economic climate as similar to &lsquo;The Great Depression&rsquo; rather than coming to understand it more closely resembling &lsquo;The Gilded Age,&rsquo; we largely overlooked how The 1% continued to prosper at historically unprecedented levels while we asked the poorest in the nation to give up their food and medicine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often, discussions about &ldquo;reigning in government spending&rdquo; were framed as necessary because of the country&rsquo;s growing debt that would hinder economic recovery and indebt future generations.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one instance where comparisons back to &lsquo;The Great Depression&rsquo; were not useful, as history tells us the Depression was severely hindered when New Deal programs were cut back in 1933.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn43"" name=""_ednref43"" title="""">[43]</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;Still, these arguments were only plausible because while we did not compare our time back to &lsquo;The Great Recession,&rsquo; in argument about government spending, we still failed to recognize that, much like &lsquo;The Gilded Age,&rsquo; government debt was perpetuating inequality.&nbsp; While wars and increasing health care costs played a role in putting the United States deep into the red, the single biggest reasons for our debts are tax cuts that began with the &lsquo;Trickle-Down&rsquo; economic policies of Reagan and then exponentially increased during the administration of George W. Bush&mdash;although the latter president framed tax cuts as &lsquo;across the board&rsquo; even though they benefitted primarily &lsquo;The 1%.&rsquo;&nbsp; However, by framing the cuts as if they benefit everyone, it is much less likely the tax reform would be recognized for what it is: a policy essentially straight from &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; given that an elite few manipulated the state for their elite interests.&nbsp; Furthermore, if we would somehow recognize that right now the economic climate is more comparable to &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; than &lsquo;The Great Depression,&rsquo; all discussion of government debt would likely cease as we would also likely recognize household debt is much more problematic because too many households are paying off old bills rather than making the new purchases that drive a consumer-based economy like ours.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn44"" name=""_ednref44"" title="""">[44]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More recently, both candidates and office holders focus their attention on public statements on unemployment, and they often make these proposals by noting unemployment is, and has been, at sustained heights not seen since the Great Depression.&nbsp; While this is likely in some part due to upcoming elections, and running on jobs is a platform few voters could ever disagree with, it is also likely due in large part because we think of our time as akin to &lsquo;The Great Recession.&rsquo; This leads to the conclusion the biggest issue our country faces is unemployment.&nbsp; Of course, even with comparisons of the contemporary jobs crisis to &lsquo;The Great Depression,&rsquo; this has not compelled any politician to seriously consider action on the scale of FDRs massive job programs even though our infrastructure is outdated and even crumbling.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn45"" name=""_ednref45"" title="""">[45]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, while the talk of fixing unemployment is mostly just that, it does reinforce the misconstruing of own gilded age with &lsquo;The Great Depression.&rsquo;&nbsp; While unemployment is both high, and we should never underestimate the personal consequences of not working for any period of time,<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn46"" name=""_ednref46"" title="""">[46]</a><sup>,<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn47"" name=""_ednref47"" title="""">[47]</a></sup>we should also accept that the historically low wages of our &lsquo;Gilded Age&rsquo; means lower unemployment is not going to fix the actual problem we face in the United States: inequality (which is of course at historically high levels in large part because wages are historically so low).<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn48"" name=""_ednref48"" title="""">[48]</a>&nbsp; Under these &lsquo;New Gilded Age&rsquo; conditions, we could miraculously achieve full employment; yet if those jobs do not pay a living wage, a vast majority of &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo; will still have a lifestyle as if they were living during a second great depression.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn49"" name=""_ednref49"" title="""">[49]</a><sup>,<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn50"" name=""_ednref50"" title="""">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>
	<strong>Comparing Today&rsquo;s Economy to the Gilded Age Era</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An example is useful to highlight how today&rsquo;s economy is much more comparable to &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; than &lsquo;The Great Depression.&rsquo;&nbsp; Growing up in the remnants of an Appalachian coal mining town, even our elementary school teachers lectured us about the gruesome lessons of &lsquo;The Gilded Age.&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Classes often focused not only on strikes and deadly accidents, but I also learned about the regular business practices at the mines which ensured companies maintained almost total control over labor in order to exploit workers any and every which way they could.&nbsp; In addition to keeping wages low by busting unions and reducing solidarity by exploiting racial and ethnic divides between workers, companies also controlled workers by paying them in currency only redeemable at company owned outlets. I spent the early years of my life in a company-owned house that was once owned by a mine and rented out by miners.&nbsp; My grandfather would send me to get the mail at the post office right next to the old company store that once overcharged workers so they would be perpetually indebted.&nbsp; If workers did somehow garner a wage increase, rent and food prices would simply rise proportionally so owners could maintain the profits and thereby continue to expand their fortunes.&nbsp; Their power over the political process at all levels ensured either the system was unlikely to change in ways that would undermine their profits or benefit the workers.&nbsp; The power of these robber barons also ensured elites were never held accountable when they crossed legal lines.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today&rsquo;s labor and compensation practices seem much more akin to &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; described above than &lsquo;The Great Depression&rsquo; as the entire economic system is designed so the few can benefit from the hard work of the many regardless of how the economy performs. Consider a typical person&rsquo;s career and lifestyle.&nbsp; Most now begin careers by pursuing a college degree, which is often accomplished by securing student loans from large banks subsided by tax dollars.&nbsp; Increasingly, those tax dollars are redirected away from colleges and universities themselves, which increase the costs of education to the benefit of the large banks who increasingly provide larger and larger loans.&nbsp; At the same time, universities and colleges are pressured to reduce costs which often come at the expense of the educations they can provide because of larger classes, outdated technology, and instructors who are less available because they teach more sections of larger classes with outdated technology.&nbsp; Thus, students are increasingly borrowing more and more for educations that are of a lesser quality, and this occurs because the system is designed not to educate but to direct resources towards large banks and the financial sector under the guise of providing educations.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn51"" name=""_ednref51"" title="""">[51]</a>&nbsp; Many students even now pay to work for free through unpaid internships.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn52"" name=""_ednref52"" title="""">[52]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully these indebted students will graduate and secure employment, although statistics show that jobs will be at historically low wages even though that new employee will likely produce at historically high levels&mdash;in large part because of the educational investments they made in themselves.&nbsp; Those low wages will be justified with arguments that the global labor market is competitive, and those arguments might be partially true for &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo; of workers in a corporation; &lsquo;The 1%s are of course in a position to benefit from the global race to the bottom.&nbsp; For global corporations that are increasingly employing a larger and larger proportion of the workforce as they force smaller operations to go out of business, corporate officers are positioned to take advantage of historically low wages by padding their own salary with profits gained because of increasingly exploited labor across the globe.&nbsp; Of course, &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo; are told to ignore corporate profits and instead focus on how lower production costs benefits consumers with lower prices.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn53"" name=""_ednref53"" title="""">[53]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, with the decline of small businesses, it is increasingly likely that worker will be employed by a publically traded company.&nbsp; The employee is thus likely to work harder and harder not for bonuses or raises but under the threat of unemployment.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn54"" name=""_ednref54"" title="""">[54]</a>&nbsp; This means they are essentially working against themselves, as their increased productivity will benefit primarily the financial sector that hedges their bets that workers will work harder and harder for less and less&mdash;all the while they seek out workers in the far reaches of the world who are willing to work for less and less.&nbsp; That employee is also likely to pay more and more for their health care, while insurance companies and their investors earn more and more by reducing the quantity and quality of care that the worker receives.&nbsp;&nbsp; With pensions pretty much relegated to history, that employee is also likely to invest in a individual retirement plan like a 401k, which provides capital for the financial industry invest for their own gain while providing a legitimate outlet to direct losses.&nbsp; This worker may also choose to take on a mortgage, which is increasingly likely to come from a large bank, thus ensuring even more of their capital is redirected to financial sector.&nbsp; In fact, the mortgage itself may be securitized and sold back to the worker through their retirement account.&nbsp; Thus, many workers are actually paying on their mortgage twice, which means the financial industry will benefit from the payments while the worker loses investment capital with falling home prices.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn55"" name=""_ednref55"" title="""">[55]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the worker is technically paying their mortgage in triplicate, because their tax dollars are also likely going to subsidize the same financial sector that exploits the worker through their consumption.&nbsp; This is likely the case unless the worker makes so little they become part of &lsquo;The 47%&rsquo; who do not make enough to pay federal taxes, as the costs of student loan interest, mortgage interest, medical bills, and the deductions for any children this worker might have negate their federal liability.&nbsp; Thus, whereas Wall Street financiers are not only taxed at a lower rate because they make money from investments, they will also get to write-out the full costs of their second mortgages while the regular worker may not make enough to take full advantage of the deductions and write-offs the tax system instituted in days gone by to promote the economic development of &lsquo;The 99%.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these practices that essentially shift capital away from &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo; and toward &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; are much more similar to what we witnessed during &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; than &lsquo;The Great Depression.&rsquo;&nbsp; While the processes are inherently more complex and illusive than the more straightforward 19<sup>th</sup> century practices where you worked for an employer only to hand back your paycheck in the form of rent and company store credit, the end result of redirecting capital upward through exploitative practices is exactly the same.&nbsp; However, the illusive operation of our larger economic system is concealed as we compare current economic conditions to &lsquo;The Great Depression&rsquo; instead of recognizing that much like &lsquo;The New Gilded Age&rsquo; economy work exactly as elites designed it to do; or it is only working for &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; who have the power to manipulate every, if not all aspects of the economy for their gain that comes at the expense of &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We study history because knowing where we have been is often an excellent way to understand where we are, and where we are likely to go&mdash;or in some cases, to avoid where we are heading.&nbsp; Yet, the power of retrospection can also be used to guise our reality; or to make us think we are somewhere quite apart from our actual existence.&nbsp; This is the case of contemporary socio-economic context as we tend to think of ourselves either immersed in or during the early stages of recovery from a second &lsquo;Great Depression.&rsquo;&nbsp; While there are a few historic parallels between today and the early 1930s, evidence suggests comparisons to &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; would be much more appropriate because the political and economic systems operate in ways that benefit a small group who sit atop the socio-economic at the expense of the vast majority.&nbsp; Thus, if we are to use history to guide us toward a better time that benefits everyone as opposed to a select few, we need to recognize our reality for what it is:&lsquo;The New Gilded Age.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>

	Game and &quot;virtual&quot; worlds are artifacts.&nbsp; If you know where to look, you can search inside these &quot;synthetic&quot; worlds (Castronova) and the software that constructs them to find traces of their makers&#39; abandoned plans and future projects.&nbsp; Access to the process of creating such a world is related perhaps to the digging of an archaeologist or spelunking of a cave-crawler.&nbsp; It is a process of exploring hidden spaces that reveal their earlier, incomplete or abandoned states, including areas that are not meant to be seen because they are still under construction.&nbsp; How might we curate the incomplete spaces and models created by human programmers, designers and artists, as well as the work of their explorers?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	One idea about searching for the &quot;hidden archive&quot; of a virtual world would lead to materials collected for its construction, from art assets to source code. This documentation is naturally of historical interest and could be considered as materials gathered or created by the &quot;authors&quot; of a virtual world that are not generally accessible by other parties. They are, in a sense, the unpublished notes and drafts of the creators of software-based worlds.&nbsp; This take aligns with Dan Cohen&#39;s description of scholarly hidden archives as &quot;the secondary products of scholarship: the bibliographies, notes, personal finding aids, and assessments by scholars of which items are important and unimportant in an archive.&quot;&nbsp; (Cohen, &ldquo;Interchange&rdquo;) The eerily parallel situations would make for an interesting comparison. However, I have something else in mind.</p>
<p>
	Instead of focusing on the architects, this essay is about the diggers and spelunkers who uncover hidden artifacts and archives of virtual worlds. It is also about the documentation they create and disseminate.&nbsp; I am interested in their efforts not just to find hidden spaces, but to reveal what they found through screenshots, machinima, and other forms of communication.&nbsp; The world in question is Blizzard Entertainment&#39;s <em>World of Warcraft (WoW)</em>, and its archeologists and cave-crawlers were a small, mysterious group known as the Nogg-aholics.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Unlike most groups in massively-multiplayer games like <em>WoW,</em> the Nogg-aholics were not primarily organized as an in-game guild, but rather as a &quot;community&quot; of <em>WoW</em> players called the Nogg-aholic Collaboration (NAC).&nbsp;&nbsp; During their halcyon days, from 7 Jan. 2006 to 7. Jan 2007, they gathered instead around an information resource, the Nogg-aholic Forum, and a collaborative machinima project, &quot;My Burning Valentine.&quot; Led by prominent <em>WoW</em> explorers such as Dopefish, Malu05 and Snoman, this group of players applied their &quot;leet skills&quot; to &quot;explore the unexplored,&quot; a motto affixed to many screenshots of hidden areas in the game credited to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&lt;put image 1 here&gt;</p>
<p>
	The skills required to explore hidden areas in WoW and reveal them creatively to the player community can be divided into two main categories: exploration and documentation. The first category includes abilities that enable players to get around the virtual world and discover places that are normally difficult to reach. At the time the Nogg-aholics were active<em>, WoW</em> included numerous areas that were still under construction or inaccessible without the use of player tricks or knowledge of software glitches in the game.&nbsp; Efforts to investigate these places owed a debt to common practices in digital game culture such as glitching and Easter egg hunting.&nbsp; Many classic console games included hidden areas, going back to the first &quot;Easter egg,&quot; a hidden room and message in Atari&#39;s <em>Adventure</em> (1979).&nbsp; Even without secret rewards, adventure, role-playing and many other game genres require extensive exploration, and players often documented what they found with maps and screenshots. Indeed, Dopefish&#39;s moniker paid homage to an object, the Dopefish, that was hidden (and discovered by players) in dozens of games as a tribute to its original appearance in the Commander Keen game, <em>Secret of the Oracle</em> (1991).&nbsp; While easter eggs are created intentionally by programmers, many games also contain bugs or &quot;glitches&quot; that produce unanticipated game artifacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As James Newman has pointed out, a glitch such as the &quot;Minus World&quot; in the original version of Nintendo&#39;s <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. (1985) became &quot;a morsel to be found and savoured by the expert gamer.&quot;&nbsp; (Newman 113) Easter eggs, glitches and other revealed artifacts of game worlds have become part of the shared cultures of digital games.</p>
<p>
	The Nogg-aholics primarily used three techniques to reach <em>WoW&#39;s</em> hidden areas: exploits (understood in the broadest sense to include unorthodox, but legal player skills), private servers, and analysis of <em>WoW</em> data files.&nbsp; Their exploits included tricks such as &quot;instance switching&quot; and &quot;wall-walking.&quot; Wall-walking, for example, enabled players to exploit glitches in the game physics to reach areas that were not supposed to be accessible during 2006, such as Hyjal or &quot;Developer&#39;s Island.&quot; They returned with screenshots and videos as proof of their discoveries and thus built an archive of hidden spaces for viewing and speculative commentary by other players.&nbsp; Private servers emulated the official Blizzard server software.&nbsp; Players on a private server enjoyed unrestricted access to every feature of the game, including equipment, abilities and areas that were unavailable on Blizzard&#39;s official servers. It was hardly surprising that authoring, hosting or using the <em>WoW</em> client on a private server was (and is) a violation of the game&#39;s End User License Agreement (EULA).&nbsp; Using private servers, while not a common practice of the Nogg-aholics, nevertheless added to the maverick reputation of the group and sharpened the edge of potential disagreements with Blizzard about their activities.&nbsp; Finally, by early 2006 as the Nogg-aholics were launching their on-line forum, new tools such as John (Darjk) Steele&rsquo;s WoW Model Viewer opened up the game&rsquo;s model database to their curious gaze.&nbsp; The Model Viewer and a similar tool called the Map Viewer read files stored in Blizzard&#39;s MPQ (for &quot;Mike O&#39;Brien Pack&quot; or Mo&#39;PaQ) format, giving players direct access to every level map, character and equipment model, particle effect, animationor other game asset in the game, including metadata. &nbsp;Initially, players used the viewer in order to view character animations or inspect items they had little chance of ever seeing as in-game loot.&nbsp; Before long, machinima creators realized that they could create videos by compositing models and maps, editing these elements, and even mixing them with live in-game performance to make movies.&nbsp; The Nogg-aholics, including several who were expert in machinima production, used these tools to reveal places and items that were not available in the current version of the game, either because they had been dropped from development or were essentially place-holders for future implementation.</p>
<p>
	&lt;put image 2 here&gt;</p>
<p>
	The link between exploration and machinima production leads to the tactics deployed by the Nogg-aholics to reveal the abandoned and hidden artifacts of <em>WoW,</em> as well those &quot;in draft&quot; or under construction.&nbsp; Machinima -- moviemaking based on game environments and engines -- was a key tool.&nbsp; Indeed, &quot;My Burning Valentine&quot; was the project that prompted the public roll-out of the Nogg-aholics and their on-line forum.&nbsp; Machinima creators do not just use digital games as a production technology. They work inside game spaces and software to scout locations, and to build or find sets, artwork, and animation, as well. These skills emphasize abilities beyond cinematography, such as exploration and finding places that are special either for their visual qualities or their meaning to an audience consisting primarily of players. By 2006, <em>WoW </em>movies had become an essential part of the game&rsquo;s culture as it grew in popularity. Moreover, the adoption of techniques such as editing models or creating new animations for them, based on discovery through the Model Viewer, occurred just as the Nogg-aholics project took off early in 2006. For example, Deeprun Goldwin Michler&#39;s &quot;The Man Who Can&rdquo; (2006), depicted a character who joyfully escapes the limitations imposed by Blizzard&#39;s pixels with new moves animated by Michler.&nbsp; Machinima projects such as Tristan Pope&rsquo;s &ldquo;Switcher&rdquo; series (2005-2006), Jason Choi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Edge of Remorse&rdquo; (2006), and Mike Spiff Booth&#39;s &quot;Code Monkey&quot; (2006) all utilized model/map discovery, manipulation, and compositing. The leading edge of model editors included Dopefish and Snoman, both prominent among the Nogg-aholics, and others who were influenced by them, such as Baron Soosdon (then known as Soosisti).</p>
<p>
	We can imagine the <em>World of Warcraft&#39;</em>s hidden archives by considering examples of three categories of middle-state artifacts exposed or created by the Nogg-aholics, ranging from those created (and barred) by Blizzard to those made by the players: inaccessible areas, documentary machinima, and re-imagined places.</p>
<p>
	On 3 Jan. 2006, Blizzard released WoW patch 1.90, which eliminated the abilities to &quot;walk on steep terrain&quot; or &quot;move slowly through some locked doors and gates.&quot; The patch was the first of several to constrain wall-walking as a means for exploration of certain areas.&nbsp; A few days later, #Nogg-aholic, the forum created by the Nogg-aholics, was founded. The first major <em>WoW</em> expansion, <em>The Burning Crusade,</em> was released a year later on 16 January 2007, about a week after it was &quot;decided to close down the nogg-aholic community.&quot;&nbsp; During the year between these events, the Nogg-aholics operated in the settings of the &quot;classic&quot; <em>World of </em>Warcraft at the top of their game, while Blizzard worked steadily towards the release of new content in the expansion. The game world was essentially a work-in-progress. &nbsp;The player community was intensely curious about new locations under construction.&nbsp; The level of tension between the Nogg-aholics efforts to reveal and Blizzard&#39;s to conceal steadily increased.&nbsp; An example of a hidden region not yet released to players was Mount Hyjal, an important location in <em>Warcraft</em> lore eventually opened as part of the Caverns of Time in <em>The Burning Crusade.</em>&nbsp; During the year before its release, the Nogg-aholics frequently cliffwalked into Hyjal, finding construction signs and taking screenshots of Archimonde&#39;s skeleton hanging from the World Tree. They released the images in a lengthy blog post in February of 2006 on the &quot;lack of content updates&quot; in <em>WoW.</em>&nbsp; As early as October 2005, Dopefish and Forg had released &quot;Nogg-aholic: The Movie,&quot; which included a short passage through the area around the World Tree.&nbsp; Several months later, a Hyjal walkthrough featuring Nogg-aholic screenshots and other documents, such as a &quot;pictorial guide&quot; with screenshots, posts from forums, and videos, could be found&nbsp; at &quot;Lost WoW: An Explorer&#39;s Guide.&quot; The editors of this website noted that &ldquo;since it is &lsquo;just a game,&rsquo; the world&#39;s &lsquo;history&rsquo; is lost with each patch.&rdquo; Mindful of this loss, they dedicated their work &ldquo;to the exploration of the game world, especially hidden areas and secrets, as well as its historical preservation.&quot;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Lost Wow&rdquo;) Blizzard tried to restrain explorers from reaching hidden locations such as Hyjal ahead of their expansion&rsquo;s completion. Caydiem, the game&#39;s community manager, wrote in a forum post that &quot;these places were not meant to be accessed by players.&quot;&nbsp; Wall-walking itself was &quot;an exploit, as it&#39;s doing something that goes against the proper game mechanics &hellip;&quot;&nbsp; In a later post Caydiem complained that, &quot;I apparently can&#39;t stress this enough<em>: the developers never meant for you to get these areas.&quot; </em>The official Blizzard discussion thread in which these posts appeared is no longer available on-line; the document survives only because Caydiem&#39;s response was preserved by a screenshot saved at the Nogg-aholics&#39; website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	The Nogg-aholics thus specialized in an activity that can be described as a combination of spelunking, exploration, excavation and archiving in terms appropriate for a digital environment: searching out and documenting unfinished or generally inaccessible locations in <em>World of Warcraft.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; As explorers, the guild members ventured into spaces that Blizzard as developer of the game was not ready to release to its players, such as the upcoming expansion areas for<em>The Burning Crusade.&nbsp; </em>Machinima videos created by members such as Dopefish documented what they found, seeking to provide information to the player community about these spaces.&nbsp; As one commentator later put it, these and other <em>WoW</em> explorers tried to &ldquo;document everything that was suddenly new and uncertain&rdquo; about the game world. (Howgego &ldquo;Exploration&rdquo;) A good example of the care with which the Nogg-aholics documented changes to the game world, as well as their own capacity to explore it, is given by Dopefish&#39;s documentary machinima piece, &quot;Last Wallwalk: The Movie&quot; (April 2006). Dopefish archived the movie, with a collection of screenshots and an image of Caydiem&#39;s comments about wall-walking (see above), at the Warcraft Movies website (warcraftmovies.com). They document &quot;the Last Wallwalk event that was held 02/01/2006,&quot; the day before the <em>WoW</em> patch that &quot;nerfed&quot; (disabled) wall walking.&nbsp; The inclusion of Caydiem&#39;s negative comments underscored the adversarial relationship between the Nogg-aholic&#39;s role as explorers and historians of the world and Blizzard&#39;s control of the game. Screenshots showed the efforts of Game Managers (GMs) to prevent the excursion and revealed the suspension of a participant&rsquo;s account for &quot;extreme violation of terrain and disruption of roleplay.&quot;&nbsp; The machinima video tracked dozens of players blitzing through several areas of the game world--often by wall walking--and the futile efforts of GMs to control them along the way, until at last they are all disconnected from the game server and their accounts suspended. Many of the more than 400 comments on the Warcraft Movies website about the movie nostalgically recalled not just places and practices shown in &ldquo;The Last Wallwalk,&rdquo; but memories of watching the Dopefish&#39;s machinima documentary, their window into otherwise inaccessible content.</p>
<p>
	&lt;put image 4 here&gt;</p>
<p>
	Dopefish is probably best remembered for two machinima documentaries he completed in 2005, &quot;Exploration: The Movie&quot; and its aforementioned sequel, &quot;Nogg-aholic: The Movie.&quot;&nbsp; Both movies are no longer available via the Warcraft Movies website, &quot;due to a Blizzard request. It violates their Unreleased Content policy.&quot; (&ldquo;Exploration: The Movie&rdquo;) These machinima projects were both products of Nogg-aholic efforts to document inaccessible spaces and undocumented locations found by able explorers.&nbsp; As we have seen, disagreements with Blizzard about their practices, legal tangles around the <em>WoW&rsquo;</em>s user licenses, and the developer&#39;s updates to the game code combined by 2007 to erode the Nogg-aholics&#39; ability to document and preserve evidence of hidden locations of the world.&nbsp; The impact of their projects continued in the form of new machinima practices that evolved out of access to game artifacts such as models and maps in ways pioneered by the explorers. After the closing of the Nogg-aholics forum, works such as Snoman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wandering Dreamscape&rdquo; and Baron Soosdon&rsquo;s &ldquo;I&rsquo;m So Sick,&rdquo; both issued later in 2007, exploited access to these game assets as a new technique for making <em>WoW-</em>basedvideos.&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp; Snoman made &ldquo;Wandering Dreamscape,&rdquo; the first in a series of Dreamscape pieces, as a &ldquo;tribute to the Nogg-aholic community&rdquo; and its primary video creator, Tobias &ldquo;Dopefish&rdquo; Lundmark.</p>
<p>
	Snoman&rsquo;s tribute to the Nogg-aholic community leveraged intimate knowledge of game assets and how to manipulate and modify them to construct an &ldquo;alternate <em>Warcraft.&rdquo; </em>&nbsp;He made an explicit point of using machinima to show &ldquo;what is possible when you have the tools and proper knowledge of the <em>WoW</em> data.&rdquo; (Snoman 2007)&nbsp; &ldquo;Wandering Dreamscape,&rdquo; for example, deployed over a dozen model changes to transform landscapes into alternate virtual realities. These changes were made possible by expert use of the Model Viewer, FRAPS-based video capture, composited elements from other areas in the game world, and Baron Soosdon&rsquo;s landscape model editing. The end result was a complete re-imaging and re-imagining of <em>the WoW</em> region known as The Barrens.&nbsp; Snoman&#39;s fictional reworking of this virtual game world as the &ldquo;Barrens Biohazard&quot; documented something else, as well: How exploring, revealing hidden elements of a game world, documentation, and game data could be controlled by the player, not the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"">
	<span style=""mso-tab-count:1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would like to discuss the Occupy Movement primarily in terms of its origin out of, and in response to, biopolitics as it is understood primarily by Michel Foucault and Giorgio Agamben. I will show that one of the movement&rsquo;s characteristic strategies, that of the occupation of public spaces and the creation within them of new and often temporary communities, is a productive inversion of biopolitics&rsquo; primary contemporary manifestation in the politicizing of public space manifesting at the most extreme level in the homeless, refugee, and concentration camp.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"">
	<span style=""mso-tab-count:1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Briefly, according to Foucault, biopolitics begins to achieve dominance in the nineteenth century and represents a break from the primarily negative and repressive nature of political power during earlier periods of history. In contrast to earlier forms of political organization that focused primarily on forcing certain actions and forbidding others, biopolitics is characterized by increasing attempts to create, organize and direct the diverse biological, psychological and medical forms human life takes within society. The rise of biopolitics goes hand in hand with a focus on the idea of the social body, understood as a biological system in need of general therapeutic interventions, in contrast to something like society understood in terms of a contract between individual autonomous actors. We begin to see biopolitics, for example, in city planning as it grew out of the medicalization of space through quarantine and hygiene in response to disease and the raising of collective physical, mental and sexual health to the level of political concern. It is important to stress that while biopolitics shows up around the same time in diverse and widely located social practices it is not to be understood, primarily, as a conscious strategy undertaken collectively by governing individuals. Rather, small practices provoked by specific historical demands coalesce over a large area of social life in the forms that would become biopolitics and because of the, often unintended and accidental, usefulness of these practices for reinforcing various economic and political power structures their use proliferates and strengthens into the contemporary political forms we see today. There is, then, rarely a conspiracy or large-scale plan at work.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in"">
	Although we have already set up our understanding of biopolitics in contrast with social contract theory, what Agamben has demonstrated in <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">Homo Sacer </i>is that the figure of bare life traced out through the network of fundamental human rights enshrined in the liberal social contract tradition serves as a fundamental mechanism of biopolitics. We might suggest, as I will discuss more fully later, that the vital space protected by rights is primarily marked off and protected <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">for </i>the ordering of biopolitics rather than against it. As we will see, it is this unusual fact with accounts for the form biopolitics takes in our contemporary context and towards which the Occupy Movement is largely responding.</p>

	<b style=""mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"">The Biopolitical Contours of the Financial Crisis</b></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"">
	<span style=""mso-tab-count:1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although most of the concerns of the Occupy Movement predate the financial crisis of 2007, there can be no denying that it is this crisis that brought the seriousness of these concerns into focus for a larger public and motivated a surprisingly diverse collection of people towards political activism. If we are to understand the response the Occupy Movement took to contemporary social problems we must, then, understand the crisis that largely precipitated that response. As I will show, the crisis was primarily a dramatic failure of the biopolitical regime and provoked, in the political mainstream, an attempt to strengthen and re-inscribe rather than reduce or renovate the very biopolitical strategies that precipitated the crisis to begin with.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"">
	<span style=""mso-tab-count:1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Biopolitics in its early formulations grows largely out of the need to defend and encourage the health of a society&rsquo;s workers and their maintenance of a working population through healthy reproduction. This goal manifests alongside the need to properly shape the consciousness and bodies of the working classes to increase their productivity and efficiency within an industrialized capitalist context. To take one specific example, the rise of prisons and the focus on rehabilitation serves two major purposes. First, in fact if not by intention, prisons provide a controlled test case in which practices for disciplining collective bodily behaviors can be developed and observed. How does one efficiently get many men to engage in the same activities at the same time? How do you get them to move swiftly and calmly from place to place? How do you get them to eat within a limited time frame while serving themselves and cleaning up after themselves? How do you instill, generally, self-conscious hygiene to avoid the outbreak of disease? When seen from this perspective, most of what a prison&rsquo;s organization is concerned with is not the repressive control of specific forbidden actions but rather the creation, structuring, and encouragement of a general mode of bodily existence. It is when these practices are generalized to the whole of society that biopolitics is truly born.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in"">
	The other accomplishment of the prison, which in turn will be repeated throughout society, is ironically found in what seems to be its fundamental failure. Prisons did not, and have never, served to decrease the occurrence of crime. As either deterrents or systems of rehabilitation they have been dramatic failures. With the instituting of the prison crime and recidivism increase.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" style=""mso-footnote-id:ftn1"" title=""""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span style=""mso-special-character:footnote""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT;

The invention of the idea of the delinquent, understood as a young person with the newly created &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; consciousness, is the complimentary psychological ground of the creation of such a class. This, however, serves a useful purpose for the general economic social structure. Energies, generally within the lower classes, that might have been directed against the political and social arrangements that helped to constitute their poverty are instead redirected against the lower classes themselves in the form of crime. Members of this same class then feel themselves more and more in need of governmental protective services to defend them from themselves. A key component, then, of biopolitics is the creation of social types, and their reduction to naturalized psycho-medical species, which goes hand in hand with a structuring of these types that serve to make their behavior predictable and implementable in the fight to defuse or redirect resistance to the general organization of society.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span></p>

	<span style=""mso-tab-count:1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While many of the strategies I have just discussed remain productively in place within the contemporary political context, there is a sharp shift that occurs from a society trying to come to grips with industrialized capitalism and one that has, instead, generally automated and outsourced most of its industrial components and instead relies upon its lower and middle class populace for consumers rather than producers. The form biopolitics takes in consumer society is distinctly different from the form it was able to take within an industrial one. The points that follow offer an, admittedly, very general sketch of what this shift looks like. The move towards a consumer society is contiguous with the shift to a service economy in which the virtues necessary for working in a factory are unnecessary, or even antithetical, to those needed for those in costumer service, teaching or office work. But beyond this, the desires necessary in a society where everyone must play the role of consumer in order to maintain a policy of non-stop economic growth are dramatically different from those needed to motivate and pacify a producing public. The factory worker can be motivated by basic needs, the necessity of making rent and acquiring food, and these same needs if just expensive enough can maintain a level of exhaustion which, when combined with the constitution of the criminal class previously discussed, can ensure that most revolutionary tendencies will be successfully annulled. In a consumer society, however, it is vital that the populace have extra spending capabilities, time and energy in order to exert the purchasing power necessary to fuel the economy. This gives rise to two very distinct problems, the answer to which end up being related.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"">
	<span style=""mso-tab-count:1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a consumer society production has been both largely automated and, at the same time, outsourced to economically and often politically dominated nations that remain within the productive and not the consumptive mode. This means that, at first, the jobs available to the non-owning classes are dramatically limited. It was partially this dynamic which Marx believed would lead to revolution to the extent that the benefits accruing to society through new technological automation primarily go to the upper owning classes while having the reverse effect upon the working class by making their jobs unnecessary. For the society to avoid revolution it must accomplish two related things. First, it must create new, generally non-productive, jobs that can both keep the majority of society from starving while also providing the purchasing power to drive the economy. Secondly it must, as always, find a dependable way to dissolve revolutionary energies. But, the first problem cannot be answered as simply as it seems because the transformation from a productive to a consuming society is driven by a process that seeks to consolidate more of the society&rsquo;s wealth in the upper classes. The automation and outsourcing of industrial jobs is motivated by the desire not to have to pay workers, or to be able to pay them much less. So, simply paying the consuming-serving classes the same amount of the society&rsquo;s wealth that used to be provided to the productive classes or, as is necessary for robust consumption, paying them more would serve to again dissipate the concentration of excess wealth in the hands of the few that drove automation and outsourcing to begin with. The answer to both the problem of purchasing power and the problem of dissolving revolutionary energies will take the form of debt.<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" style=""mso-footnote-id:ftn2"" title=""""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span style=""mso-special-character:footnote""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT;

	<span style=""mso-tab-count:1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Brilliantly, the way to maintain purchasing power in the lower and middle classes while keeping them from demanding extensive political and economic changes is to provide them with an excessive purchasing power that, at the same time, does not provide actual wealth or economic security. While, over the last several decades, the pay of middle and lower class jobs in America has stayed the same or gone down relative to purchasing power, consumption has generally increased and the price of things like property, education and medical care have sky-rocketed. This occurs through the exponential expansion of credit and debt that creates an economic regime based entirely on the increasing indebtedness of the middle and lower classes to upper classes that have benefitted from the arrangement through ever increasing monopolization of wealth. What it is important to notice here is the centrality of this development to the very existence of a consumer society. Without new, and biologically unnecessary, desires the economy deprived of industrial production can not exist and, similarly, without finding a way to drive consumption without in fact paying the consuming classes the money saved by the automation and exportation of production such a society is not justified in the eyes of its ruling classes. While inescapable indebtedness often arises from individual decisions, such decisions and such indebtedness is the unavoidable presupposition of, for example, the American economy. A non-industrial and generally non-productive economy without a general state of &ldquo;irresponsible&rdquo; debt would stagnate, starve and/or collapse.</p>

	The state of contemporary debt, much like the rise in crime due to the institution of the prison, is not actually a sign of a failure of the practices in question but rather a central part of their justification and, just as in the case of the creation of a criminal class, it also serves to redirect revolutionary impulses. While the industrial worker was kept from resisting the social structure through exhaustion, fear of immediate starvation, fear of crime or through having any such energy directed into crime against other members of the same class consumers are kept from revolution through the constant fear of losing the jobs which pay them just enough to pay the minimum payments on their mortgages, student loans and credit cards or which alone provide them with the privately inaccessible health insurance which keeps them from certain poverty should they get injured or sick. Much like the answer to the question of why we maintain prisons when they don&rsquo;t serve to lessen crime was answered by recognizing they aren&rsquo;t really meant to reduce crime, so too the answer to the question of why medical and educational costs are allowed to rise mostly unbridled is that the debt, or fear of economic ruin, such a situation creates insures that service workers do not have the leisure to question, or act to change, their society in any dramatic way.</p>

	<span style=""mso-tab-count:1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We should pause for a moment to stress that such a society runs very much like a credit card company to the extent that if all the debtors actually paid off their debt the entire system would crash. Credit card companies make their profit from endlessly collecting interest on debts, but were those debts to simply be paid off directly they would suffer dramatic economic losses due to the expenditures in which they are already engaged based on the assumption that they will be making much more money off interest than their actual outstanding loans constitute. On the national and international level the state of debt is the same, economic growth or even stability is predicated on most debtors paying the minimum payment on their debts not on their paying off their debts. Were the debts to be paid off, again, the system would collapse based on the over-expenditure dependent on interest that economic growth consists in. So, all moralizing to the contrary, it is vital for the consumer society that people not pay off their debts directly but rather pay agonizingly over time much more than they ever owed. Beyond this, however, it is also flat out impossible, not only in practical but more importantly in mathematical terms, for current outstanding debts to be paid. As David Graeber points out, the collective international debt surpasses the combined Gross Domestic Products of every nation on the earth.<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" style=""mso-footnote-id:ftn3"" title=""""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span style=""mso-special-character:footnote""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT;

As already mentioned, just like a credit card company such a system requires most debtors to pay their minimum payment, but as pay fails to increase and economic growth along with growth in consumption continues to be the driving goal of the economy, debt and the minimum payment it is necessary most people be able to pay increases. The lack of purchasing power due to the loss of productive jobs and the isolation of profits in the top classes of society was corrected for through credit but this was only ever an imperfect and temporary bandage on a massive problem. The crisis of 2007 occurred largely because the minimum payment required of a group of debtors, mainly those involved in certain types of mortgages, was no longer able to be met by a large enough collection of those debtors for the system to continue. But, considering the larger contours of the debt economy, this was only a very small bump heralding, potentially, much larger problems down the road. <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

	<span style=""mso-tab-count:1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At this point we must take a step back and connect more clearly what we have said to the issue of biopolitics. When we first began discussing biopolitics it showed up in terms of overt government actions, for example in terms of the establishment of prisons and city planning, but in discussing consumer society we have transitioned to discussing general aspects of the economy which seem to rest mostly within the realm of business and market forces rather than governmental actions. How is it that we are still discussing politics at all? The answer arises from the recognition that even early forms of biopolitics arise from governmental power&rsquo;s direct concern to stabilize and make more efficient its productive forces, forces that are essential for the financial and military power of the state and the wealth of the richest individuals within the state. Furthermore, the very individuals that constitute those institutions expressing governmental biopower are either those whose interests are served through increased economic productivity and efficiency or those who are primarily influenced by the pressure exerted through moneyed interests. This interconnection of financial and governmental concerns makes it such that market and political forces are not only reinforcing but also that the business of governing in the age of biopolitics is &ldquo;outsourced&rdquo; more and more to corporate entities. This alone would have been unimaginable, at least on anything like the scale we see it, in the era of primarily repressive rather than creative state sovereignty as expressed, for example, by strong monarchies. Consumer society is governed, then, through a politico-commercial matrix of practices and institutions from which independent entities such as government and market can only artificially be abstracted and through which the life of individuals are structured almost exclusively in terms of their market existence. As Foucault observes at the end of his course on biopolitics, &ldquo;&hellip;American neoliberalism seeks rather to extend the rationality of the market, the schemes of analysis it proposes, and the decision making criteria it suggests to areas that are not exclusively or not primarily economic. For example, the family and birth policy, or delinquency and penal policy.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" style=""mso-footnote-id:ftn4"" title=""""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span style=""mso-special-character:footnote""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT;

	<span style=""mso-tab-count:1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We can make this point more convincing by looking at the concrete local actions of governing power which structure most of our daily lives. Let us consider a topic that will be central to understanding the importance of the strategy of occupying public spaces. How are ways of life structured and created through the governing of public spaces? Theoretically public spaces such as public streets or parks are areas in which what one can or cannot do is determined primarily in terms of basic rights and the laws that are not to interfere with those rights. When I am within such a public space the law&rsquo;s relation to me should, according to this theory, be determined by the extent to which I respect the rights of others and act within the protected space of my own rights. In other words, legal existence within public space should be determined by considerations of my sheer status as citizen. In actuality, however, what we see is that public space, carved out we might say by the limitations and protects of personal rights, does not represent a space of freedom but rather a space in which the biopolitical determination of the individual as consumer is primary. We see this when we note the strange way in which utterly incidental characteristics become criminal within public space. This occurs primarily on the level of local laws addressing loitering, homelessness and protest. Before we discuss concrete examples it is worth tying the specific biopolitical power I have in mind to the view of biopolitics presented by Agamben in his book <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:

	<span style=""mso-tab-count:1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Agamben biopolitical power is the power to isolate out the bare life of citizens and, through their reduction to bare life, except them from the normal protection of law. Anyone, in other words, who approaches the point of existing only as a living human and not also in terms of more robust social roles enters the legal region in which the brute expression of state force is primary. This area is precisely, however, that which is supposed to be protected by general human or specific national rights. This legal region is called the state of exception and Agamben suggests it is primarily in terms of declaring what will count as a state of exception and placing specific groups or individuals into such states of exception that biopolitical power functions. This in term suggests that the reverse is also true, that biopolitical power also functions in terms of specifying implicitly what ways of life one must lead in order to avoid being placed within a state of exception. For consumer society, then, any failure to live the life of a consumer, especially in public space, endangers one&rsquo;s protection from arbitrary use of governmental force. <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:

	<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>We can offer both dramatic and everyday examples of this power to declare a state of exception. But, if most governmental power is biopolitical and most such power is really to have this characteristic, we would expect to find many common everyday examples and we do. Any situation in which an apparent right or freedom disappears because of the, often implicit, declaration of a state of exception due to a failure to fit the category of consumer fits the bill. There is no lack of examples.</p>

	Surely one citizen has the right to cook dinner for another. What could be a more basic freedom? Yet in the city of Jacksonville Florida, if one of the citizens in question is someone who is homeless we suddenly run into a very strange state of exception. I can cook you dinner or share my lunch, unless you lack a home. In fact, any sharing of food with strangers in a public space is outlawed but this limitation is extended to include homeless people you might know well. Almost all the laws that apply to dealing with the homeless have this strange aspect of seemingly arbitrary suspension of seemingly basic freedoms. Consider anti-loitering laws. One would imagine that any citizen has the right to occupy a bench in a public park. However, when you lack a certain amount of money this everyday freedom seemingly magically becomes an illegal activity. In many communities, my hometown in New Jersey used to have a law like this, loitering laws specify that if one does not have a legal id or a certain amount of money in one&rsquo;s pocket the simple activity of strolling through town becomes suddenly the illegal activity of loitering. But surely my status as a citizen with a right to utilize public spaces does not depend upon my possession of an id or money. When governmental power is defined by the power to declare a state of exception, however, being a citizen becomes only an abstract ideal perpetually open to revocation.</p>

	<span style=""mso-tab-count:1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The irony of the moment when governmental power becomes the power to declare a state of exception is that it is precisely the claim to one&rsquo;s rights that frequently provokes the declaration on the part of government power of a state of exception. So long as one does not seek to practice one&rsquo;s rights or appeal to the law no state of exception is necessary. However, demand your rights and you take yourself out of the protected classes of the home-owner, consumer or business-person and place yourself in the perpetually endangered, because always open to exception, class of bare-citizen.</p>

	We see this with the creation of &ldquo;free speech zones&rdquo;. Go about your daily business and you might feel that all public spaces in America function as free speech zones.

Choose, however, to make an issue of the right to free speech and your very practice of that right becomes the justification for declaring you within a state of exception which limits your right to freedom of speech to a specific area designated by governmental power, usually a fenced off out of the way protest zone. It is by demanding your rights that you become excepted from them.</p>

The number of citizens wanting to take the stroll and the reason they want to take the stroll do not count as such a hefty justification, while a dangerous gas leak might. But, gather with other citizens and demand one&rsquo;s right to walk down Wall St. and immediately you face barricades and policy brutality.</p>

	<span style=""mso-tab-count:1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is not so surprising, suggests Agamben, as the modern interest in natural rights rides on the back of a strikingly contrary view. If we follow Agamben in looking back at Greek and Roman law we see that the founding action of a city or state consists in setting off the status of community membership from that of a natural living being. To be a citizen is to be something other than, and apart from, simply an existing human being. Biopolitics extends this by governing and structuring subjects existing only within the realm of bare-life rather than simply ignoring, killing or exiling them as would be more common in the ancient context. This carries important connections to the debt crisis as well. Debt crises are not new things, though the form and necessity of debt in consumer society is a unique development. Within the ancient world there were two likely outcomes of the creation of large-scale inescapable debt and each takes the form of a state of exception. Within Mesopotamia, for example ancient Sumerian and Babylonian societies, crushing debt often forced city dwellers to reject city life and leave the boundaries of the community. These self-exiled individuals would then join nomadic communities existing outside the city walls. By doing so they were reduced, at least for a time, to the status of bare-life losing all legal protection and property as well as, from the viewpoint of city culture, facing a life much like that of a wild animal. Alternatively, those inescapably indebted often found themselves reduced to bare-life in being made into slaves, another case of being placed outside the standard boundaries of community and into a state in which they were excepted from standard legal protects, duties and privileges. Within contemporary society the debtor does not generally face debtor&rsquo;s prison, enslavement or standard exile, and indeed foreclosing the possibility of debtors escaping its social force is a major priority of biopolitics, but instead they face the risk of being placed in the more common state of exception which comes from no longer being functioning consumers. Joblessness, homelessness, and poverty, aside from their many dangers and deprivations, also bring with them a decreased protection from either the abuse of others or the often arbitrary exercise of legal force. The homeless can be herded from place to place, their rights to public space either flat out denied or dramatically limited through ever shifting relocations and baroque regulation. They exist permanently within a state of exception.</p>

	<span style=""mso-tab-count:1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this way we see the double edge nature of contemporary rights. They trace out areas of protected freedoms only to the extent that those freedoms are practiced according to the standard biopolitical dictates of consumption, work and minimal debt repayment. Without the prescribed use of these freedoms, however, rights serve rather to isolate and pick out those who have been placed, through choice or unavoidable circumstance, in a state of exception marked by their existence merely as bearers of rights.</p>

Official governmental power, especially on the local level, serves to structure and enforce citizen participation within commercial markets. It is this indivisibility of government from corporate power in the face of government&rsquo;s official claim to represent the people in general that has likely most enraged and motivated members of the Occupy Movement. A financial crisis tied essentially to the nature of the debt economy, the inability to achieve any extensive health insurance reform, repeated corporate bailouts unbalanced by bailouts for middle or lower class citizens, cuts to education and social services, the deterioration of safety nets, the lack of jobs in the face of continually growing profits to the rich and the corporations they control all in the face of consistent tax breaks to the very individuals and corporate entities that most benefit from the debt economy finally pushed too many people too far. What I hope I have shown is that each of these elements is part of the larger structure of biopolitical power that governs contemporary society. It is the brilliance of the Occupy Movement that one of the main strategies its has used is that of calling the bluff of biopolitical power.</p>

	<span style=""mso-tab-count:1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As our discussion of Agamben suggested, the most brutal form of biopolitical power is practiced upon those who exist, whether through chance or choice, within society but outside the clearly delineated roles of consumers or, generally, service-employees. These are the unemployed and, most especially, the homeless. This is why the nature of the Occupy Movement is essentially connected to the plight of the homeless. These individuals live in a non-commercial manner within public spaces that should be guaranteed for their use through their citizenship that, most assume, is independent of their commercial activity and way of life. As we have seen, however, this is not the case. Their lack of consumer contribution equates to their being excepted from their status as full citizen. In being reduced to bare citizen they are, instead, reduced to bare life to be regulated, moved about, harassed and/or &ldquo;rehabilitated&rdquo; towards the goal of allowing them to once more bodily enter the realm of consumerism. The mere holder of rights, as citizen, is revealed in these cases as actually the anti-citizen, the bare life that since the times of Ancient Greece is the antithesis of the city and state.

	<span style=""mso-tab-count:1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The camp represents a strategic weakness for the alliance between corporations, the rich and government that constitutes contemporary biopolitics precisely because individual complicity within the system depends extensively on the assumption that one&rsquo;s rights market out a space of freedom and not a space of intensified political structuring. One exists purely within the realm of one&rsquo;s rights when one exists independent of any market or economic characteristics. But such an existence in public space is precisely the fundamentally unfree existence of the homeless or the highly bureaucratized existence of the political protestor. It is very informative to consider the example of the protest organizer who is forced, willingly or not, into a market form through demands for protest licenses and, often, insurance policies. In some cities practicing one&rsquo;s right to protest can be an exceptionally expensive proposition, clearly foreclosing the practice of this right for those without consumer standing. The message of encampment is, then, that there is in practice no citizenship protected from government force. It is only when one abides by the unspoken, thought violently enforced, biopolitical demand to exist in public space as a consumer that any level of safety can be assumed. American government, and those of most developed liberal societies in the world, stand upon the illusion that certain freedoms are granted based purely upon life or citizenship when, in fact, the opposite obtains. It is pure life and citizenship that represent the realms of least freedom and security.</p>

	<span style=""mso-tab-count:1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The maintenance of the basic illusion of biopolitics depends upon the ability of most citizens to see, in the concentration camp occupant, the refugee, the homeless, etc. someone who is anything but a human or citizen. Rather, in each case, the occupant of the camp must be seen as a problem in order for the system to maintain itself. Consuming citizens must, in looking at the camp, fail to see someone existing purely within the realm of rights and instead see someone legitimately excepted of their rights because of various personal failings. What must be, above all, avoided is the recognition that in looking at the homeless one sees the figure of what our society does to those who exist fully within the protection of the very rights the thought of which sooths us to sleep at night. Here is the paradigm of the fate of the free citizen: hounded by the police; refused time and again the use of public spaces; forced from sidewalks, streets and parks; shuffled into shelters and expelled again from them on fixed schedules; bussed out of town or to other towns against their will; arrested, released, vilified and ignored. Here is the hero of the political faery tale, existing as equal to all others endowed with inalienable rights.</p>

	<span style=""mso-tab-count:1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This weakness in the system of biopolitics which would convince us to be reassured by our citizenship while, at the same time, conferring upon its concrete existence nothing but fear and disgust explains both the effectiveness of the practice of occupation as protest and the strategies used against it. It is ironic that the resemblance of occupation to homelessness, extend by the media to often direct claims that occupiers just are homeless and unemployed, touches upon an important and powerful element of the movement while using it as a justification for dismissing the movement. It becomes essential, then, for the movement that the brutality meted out by the police to be seen as directed against those types of citizens that the majority of people have not already accustomed themselves to viewing as problems rather than citizens. This can, as a side note, lead to the dangerous tension within the Occupy Movement to distance ourselves from the very people whose position we are choosing to enter, namely the illegitimated homeless.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:

	The connection between the two positions I have discussed, that of non-commercial protestor and non-commercial homeless, is seen even more clearly when we consider the Kafkaesque rationality that allows governmental forces to except both camps from their rights to the use of public space, public assembly and protest. It is staggering to consider that the vast paramilitary force used in clearing Zuccotti Park in New York City including helicopter surveillance, clearing several city blocks of any form of traffic, disruption of public transportation, journalistic blackouts, to say nothing of the extensive police forces and militaristic hardware mobilized, were all justified for seeming negligible biopolitical concerns such as the need to clean the park and address concerns of the businesses in the area. Apparently aesthetic, hygienic, and commercial concerns unquestionably trump those most basic rights upon which our political system is supposed to be based. It is this same typically biopolitical combination of aesthetic, hygienic and commercial justifications that motivate the domination and repression of homeless citizens by local authorities. <span style=""mso-tab-count:1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

	<span style=""mso-tab-count:1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The path we have followed makes clear that the violent response the Occupy Movement has faced, while utterly horrifying, is not at all surprising. The movement has placed itself outside the roles created, encouraged and finally demanded by biopolitical power and, in doing so, has dared the governing forces to demonstrate how they really treat those who address them not from the position of consumers, servants or owners but rather as citizens reduced to their basic rights alone. Throughout America and elsewhere in the world the government-corporate powers have done precisely that, revealing exactly where one stands when one stands only as a citizen. The answer is that one stands in the range of tear gas, pepper spray, police batons and precisely not within a public space in which you are recognized as having any rights of use, assembly or protest. If we recall that biopolitics arose as a positive project to structure and direct ways of life rather than just forbid or command certain actions we see that, when pushed to its extreme, biopolitics can be made to collapse back into a purely negative and repressive form of power. This, in turn, dissolves for those who pay attention the illusions upon which biopower&rsquo;s benign appearance depends. <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span></p>

	<span style=""mso-tab-count:1"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reclamation of the camp from the forces of biopolitics, while achieving the strategic victories I have mentioned and providing a platform from which an extensive critique of contemporary biopolitics can be heard, has also involved a rich productive side as well. Within the space of the camp, a space excepting itself from consumer existence and excepted externally from protection from government violence, the temporary and fragile opportunity to explore what community might be free of biopolitics takes shape. It is in this sense that the practices embodied in general assemblies, organizing groups and soap boxes across the country offer a new and vibrant image of what the political is, namely community membership. Across the country and in many other places throughout the world people are creating, discovering and learning anew what it means to be responsibly active in a community, what it means to be political. A friend asked me what I thought was the most important lesson I had learned so far from the movement. My response was that politics consists in what we do every day. It is a way of existing within a community. Within contemporary consumer society politics, like everything else, is bought and sold. It is a product in the media, and a passively consumed product at that. For some citizens the only real political moment is periodic voting, at least for the minority who actually vote. What we learn from the consensus forming practices of the movement and the community they build and strengthen is that politics is not, or not only, about people you rarely meet making decisions you frequently don&rsquo;t hear about or don&rsquo;t fully understand in places you may never have seen in person. Rather, politics is the art of the <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">polis</i>, of the community, the art of existing with others and making decisions about what is important and what should be done together. Not only, then, is politics first and foremost local it is also a way of life, and one which biopolitics works above all to foreclose for it is, in its most basic form, non-commercial and unable to be consumed or purchased. It can only be lived.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span></p>

	The image above is a digital surrogate from a pre-press original for the cover of <em>Fantastic Four </em>55 (Marvel Comics, October 1966), with pencil artwork by Jack Kirby and inked by Joe Sinnott. The letterer is unknown. Please note how the handmade cut-and-paste layout design work was applied on top of the original penciled and inked artwork. This document reveals the layers of manual craftmanship involved in the creative and reproduction process; paper, ink, glue, and xerox copying traceable as the textual markers that would be flattened out in the process of mechanical reproduction to result in the final form of colour printing. This image is a survivor of an industrial creative and production process that assumed the pre-press original&#39;s functional nature, a mere means to an end: the printed publication. It is a fact that a look back at the past of comic books is always clouded in the smoke of furnaces (Hajdu 2009). Gravett and Stanbury (2006) have lamented the way the history of comics has been determined by the history of their destruction:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:28.35pt;"">
	Sniff the air once again [&hellip;] and you&rsquo;ll detect another whiff strongly associated with British comics: the telltale smell of burning paper and artboard turning to ashes. Seen merely as another stage in the production process by many publishers, pages of original artwork would be used by them to prop up a wobbly table, mop up a spillage or be casually disposed of to save time and expense. One employee can still chuckle to himself at the memory of his consigning most of the artwork from [a] weekly comic into a flaming brazier&quot; (Gravett and Stanbury 2006:6).</p>
<p>
	The comics scholar therefore faces the hurdles imposed by a lack of systematised, browsable archives, which in many cases means the inability to work directly with the source material. Many comics publications have completely disappeared, making thorough critical engagements with the comics form more difficult. The scarcity of historical primary sources can be also explained by the very history of the comics form, its material conditions of production and its particular place within print culture.&nbsp; The &quot;original&quot; in mainstream superhero comics of this era was always a collective and collaborative effort, and the artwork&#39;s whole purpose was to be reproduced as a monthly or bi-weekly stapled publication printed in colour. The production process of American mainstream comic books implied an industrialised process that constrained artistic expression within strict guidelines and the quick delivery of the work to the reader, as a result of censorship and market demands. The high costs of production became another obstacle, due to the number of active participants in the process whose wages had to be paid from the books&#39; sales. In comparison, the &quot;underground&quot; model of production would offer a simpler process, reinstating the authorial role of the artist and writer that had been lost in the transition from the age of the newspaper comic strip at the end of the 19th century to the dawn of the comic book in the late 1930s.</p>
<p>
	The underground comics revolution of the late 1960s and early 70s, like the subsequent mini-comics movement of the 1990s, involved the author directly in the design, reproduction (photocopying), binding, distributing and selling of his/her creation. As was the case for the medieval scribe, the underground comic artist made use of a scriptorium that was not only limited to the actual drawing and writing of the graphic story, but also to the physical production of the publication itself. The late 1960s allowed underground comics to move into the realm of self-publishing thanks to the technological evolutions in photomechanical reproduction. Developments in photocopying technology allowed artists to produce originals in larger or smaller sizes that would later be amplified or reduced in the Xerox machine. Pre-press mechanical originals of the covers and title pages were composed in a combination of manual and xeroxed processes, and often the panel illustrations integrated handmade drawings with photocopying, photomontage and collage techniques, as practiced for example by Jack Kirby (1917- 1994) in the United States and Alberto Breccia in Argentina (1919-1993), which would influence a younger generation of artists such as Bill Sienkiewicz (1958-) and Dave McKean (1963-).</p>
<p>
	Until that moment, comic books had always been printed in the cheapest way possible, and large runs on high-speed offset presses were typically beyond the access of most artists. But access to mimeograph machines and electrostatic photocopying was simple and affordable, and soon technological limitations became expressive possibilities. The purple-blue duplicator ink of the mimeograph or the high-contrast, ashy toner ink of the Xerox machine are not just incidental details, but stylistic, aesthetic devices that defined, amongst other things, a political position and an artistic, literary genre. The technologies available to comic book creators, always embedded in a network of relations organised by the demands of a market that included other products of print culture (newspapers, magazines, cereal boxes, posters, record sleeves), defined the form (story) and format (type of publication) of the comics they created. Any change in format, technology or culture invariably transformed the comics text. Superhero comics and &#39;comix&#39; had in common an awareness of thie inherently technological (mechanical) nature of reproduction in connection to the unseen manual processes involved in the creation of pre-press original pages.</p>
<p>
	Walter Benjamin wrote of &quot;the decay of the aura&quot; of the original artwork when it was mechanically reproduced. This is amplified and at the same time deconstructed in comic book culture. For Benjamin the &quot;aura&quot; or the original work of art existing only in one unique period of time and place only emanated from works that had not been devalued through mechanical reproduction, the original was always-already the finished product, the final article. Paradoxically, reproduction re-canonised the aura of the original: the more an original was reproduced and distributed, the more one wanted to see <em>the one</em>. But the &quot;original&quot; artwork in comics was not seen as an end itself but as another necessary step before it achieved its ultimate end: mechanical reproduction, printing. Therefore the comic art original was always-already devoid of aura, even to its creators, who often did not seen them as items of value. If archives and collections of printed periodical comic books are still rare and largely destined to be incomplete due to the sheer amount of published material, systematic collections of pre-press originals are even harder to find; the pre-press original is a middle-state document by definition, a literal mock-up that remained hidden, deleted, burned out from the finished product and the readerly experience. In days in which the digital composition of comic art pages is widespread and taken for granted, pre-press originals like Jack Kirby&#39;s survive as incredibly valuable historical and aesthetic &quot;documents of barbarism&quot;. They are revealing long-gone pieces of the jigsaw puzzle of comic book collective creativity and artistry, the embodiment of the text as a tangible surface where history is inscribed and embossed as layers of pencil, ink, Tipp-Ex (Wite-Out) paper and glue.&nbsp;</p>

	These drawings represent the design progession of a game that the Human-Computer Interaction Lab&#39;s Intergeneration Design Team, Kidsteam, created in response to the challenge of helping children be more environmentally friendly at home, school, or while visiting the White House. The game is called Energy House and has been well received by those who have played it. A video of the gameplay can be found at http://youtu.be/DCmFeNawUS4 . Although the game is fun, I am more fond of the design process we followed than what was generated.</p>
<p>
	Kidsteam is based on the idea that children should be partners in the design of new technologies for children (Druin). In order to do this, we use various techniques to co-design these new technologies. Energy House was designed through a technique we call Layered Elaboration (Walsh et al.). I really like layered elaboration because it enables designers to build on other designers&rsquo; ideas through the use of transparent overlays or old-fashioned overhead transparencies. In short, one designer (or team) creates a design on paper, then a transparent overlay is applied, the design is given to another team who adds to the design on the transparent overlay.</p>
<p>
	We used this technique with three groups. I&rsquo;ve attached the progression of designs that the group made for helping children be more green at school. The first drawing shows the school that contains a robot and books about being more environmentally friendly. The next image shows litter with an X over it indicating that it is bad and, in the lower left corner, it has a green playground that generates electricity. The final group added a tree that displays how green you are acting&mdash;the more green you are, the more alive the tree is, but, if you act unfriendly towards the environment, the tree begins to lose leaves and withers.</p>
<p>
	That part of the story can be read in extreme detail in the previously mentioned paper on Layered Elaboration. The part that I&rsquo;m excited to talk about is the next steps towards the final proto</p>
<p>
	The idea of generating your own electricity through play was really cool. Based on discussions with the other adult Kidsteam members, I looked into attaching devices that generate electricity to things like a pogo stick. Fortunately, I have no archivable materials showing me on a pogo stick. I quickly realized that the technology would need to be screen based in order to realize the designs of the group. At this point, I shelved the idea of generating electricity.</p>
<p>
	My next prototype was to be a game that utilized the tree feedback idea. The game would allow players to build a house and the tree would let them know if they were being green or not. I only ended up making the screenshot above because I looked up from my desk and saw a USB dance pad in my home office. Our family had ordered it as a free promotion from a food company who wanted to encourage kids to move as part of the game. When we received it in the mail, we found out the online games it was designed for only worked with PCs and we had Macs. From then on, it really didn&rsquo;t get used.</p>
<p>
	While looking at it, I thought it would be cool to jump up and down on the mat to generate electricity as part of a video game. I started drawing in Flash, and switching from a school motif to a house, drew up a one-bedroom house with some energy draining objects. I made a rough prototype that was really just a drawing with an energy bar. When you pressed keys on the keyboard, the energy bar filled and then slowly drained and a window popped up letting me know what keys were pressed.</p>
<p>
	At this point, I connected the USB dance mat to the computer and used USB Overdrive as a middle-ware connector to turn jumps on the mat to keys on the keyboard. It was straightforward to make energy bars for several different things in the house and have them work independently. The final image shows the screen I worked in most of the time&mdash;using code to tweak the settings for each of the objects as well as the overall rate at which the energy builds up from jumping. I had begun to add other factors like outside temperature, air-conditioning, and a refrigerator but had to cut those in order to have it ready for the next Kidsteam design session.</p>
<p>
	I used Creative Commons licensed and public domain media for the television and music player. After it was over, the kids didn&rsquo;t like the video I had originally chosen. I found a long, public domain Bugs Bunny cartoon and used that as the video. The next time (and subsequent times) we played it, it was a huge success and generated a lot of great ideas and designs for the next version of this game.</p>

	When I began working on <em>Hypermarks: An Anthology of Electronic Literature</em> in 1999, I had grand plans. I was fresh out of graduate school and teaching courses in &ldquo;electronic literature and culture&rdquo; and &ldquo;hypertext fiction and poetry&rdquo; for the first time and in those still-heady days of bookmarks, hot lists, and home pages, I spent countless hours constructing links pages with finely tuned subcategories. In graduate school I had cut my teeth on the bulleted list &ndash; working throughout the mid 1990s on the <a href=""http://vos.ucsb.edu/""><em>Voice of the Shuttle</em></a>, the <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20110720074522/http:/english.ucsb.edu:591/rchrono/""><em>Romantic Chronology</em></a>, and <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20110720075258/http:/aad.english.ucsb.edu/""><em>The Affirmative Action and Diversity Project</em></a>, while at the same time developing my own research pages, first in the form of a catalogue of primary documents for my <a href=""http://www.english.ucsb.edu/faculty/rraley/research/englstud.html""><em>History of English Studies</em> <em>Page</em></a>. When working in the British Library in 1997, I started calling up the earliest anthologies of English poetry and meticulously transcribing their table of contents, which led to a collaboration with Laura Mandell on the <a href=""http://www.english.ucsb.edu/faculty/rraley/research/anthologies""><em>Anthologies and Miscellanies</em></a> page that we summarily described in these terms (full description below): &ldquo;we are not digital archivists per se &ndash; though we have tried to be as broadly inclusive as possible &ndash; and in the end what we have compiled is a list of texts, generally selected because they are somehow representative of critical tradition, of genre, of &lsquo;the spirit of an age,&rsquo; of epistemological ruptures.&rdquo; This then led to a collaboration with Mandell and Harriet Linkin on &ldquo;<a href=""http://www.orgs.muohio.edu/anthologies/"">The Anthologies Page</a>&rdquo; for <em>Romantic Circles</em> &ndash; another anthology and another list. Even in my dalliances I had veritable list mania, from the more high-minded transcription of Walter&rsquo;s Benjamin&rsquo;s theses on the writer&rsquo;s and critic&rsquo;s techniques to my whimsical list of cyberporn resources (&ldquo;compiled and selected with my own censorial eye, to be read only for the sake of information&rdquo;).</p>
<p>
	One of the first orders of business when I began teaching new courses, then, was the collation of links. There were some, but very few, such indices and none that I could find that articulated electronic literature both as a research-driven aesthetic practice and as an academic subject. Indeed, many of the extant indices eschewed taxonomy in favor of alphabetic order &ndash; a sure sign that a field is inchoate.</p>

<p>
	It was at this point that my plans became grand. My conviction was that the literary and artistic practices named as new media writing, net.writing, hypertext fiction, and digital poetry needed curatorial direction if they were going to become &ldquo;electronic literature,&rdquo; which is to say an academic field in its own right. Put another way, my sense was that the mode of collection and curation particular to an anthology was essential if these literary and artistic practices were to be granted the institutional recognition that they deserved. Individual academic studies &ndash; e.g. Espen Aarseth&rsquo;s <em>Cybertext</em> (1997) &ndash; were bringing the field into prominence but they alone were not going to be sufficient; what was required was a means by which works of electronic literature could be put to use in schools. In other words, we needed both knowledge of emergent literary genres and a means by which to facilitate their transmission.</p>
<p>
	Out of all this came my <em>Hypermarks</em> project, which I framed both as an anthology and as &ldquo;an index of online fiction, poetry, installations hypertext/ually in/formed.&rdquo; Begun in 1999 with support from the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota and the design assistance of two students, Aimee Houser and Martin Grider, it was, and still is, an anthology of electronic literature based on my master index but streamlined with four generic categories that more closely approximate the taxonomy of a print anthology: poetry; prose; installations &amp; exhibitions; journals &amp; indexes. Because of the use of inline frames, popups, and a form, it required Netscape 4.7 for full functionality, but its design aesthetic looked backwards to the monochromatic palette of Olia Lialina and the blue links of Mosaic. <em>Hypermarks</em> remains unfinished but is still publicly visible: number 2 on the Google search engine results page, for those mistyping &ldquo;hypermarkets.&rdquo; <em>Hypermarks</em> made the move with me from Minnesota to UC Santa Barbara, acquired a new URL, and continues to sit on our departmental server &ndash; no doubt to the chagrin of our IT administrator &ndash; but it is dormant. I never formally declared it to be shelved; and, more to the point, its shelving can only be identified retroactively, as a consequence of the cessation of work.</p>
<p>
	Absent a notice of when a page was last updated, a farewell post, or a public announcement of termination, it is sometimes difficult to determine the precise moment a project is shelved, the moment it crosses the threshold from &ldquo;in progress&rdquo; to dormancy, the moment incompleteness because its actual state. Absent as well the material acts of shelving &ndash; the deletion of either local or remote files, the surrendering of server space &ndash; incompleteness is a kind of abstraction. The potential to realize the project remains; it could, in theory, be shifted from one state of work to another, revived and moved further along toward completion. Because the possibility of its future realization is ever-present, a project without a notice of termination can really only be understood to be suspended in its &ldquo;middle state&rdquo; at the point that one realizes in retrospect that the work has stopped, that the project is no longer on a task list and has been supplanted by other ideas and other projects.</p>
<p>
	The &ldquo;middle state&rdquo; of <em>Hypermarks</em>, the limbo between conception and realization, was never articulated as such, but in-betweenness was an integral component of the project from the start. I maintained the usual theoretical skepticism about the notion of a complete collection, but <em>Voice of the Shuttle</em> had taught me to think carefully about the practical lifespan of archives, its utility as an academic resource becoming somewhat muted as search functionality increased. Moreover, <em>Hypermarks</em> was directly linked to my thinking about the mutable aspects of digital textuality. Building on Peter Lunenfeld&rsquo;s claim that electronic textuality is in a state of &ldquo;unfinish&rdquo; and Michael Joyce&rsquo;s claim that &ldquo;electronic text can never be completed,&rdquo; I was concerned in articles on the topic to show that digital textuality produced a kind of anamorphic vision, not, as for Espen Aarseth, because the anamorphic requires the reader to work to orient the text, but because it negotiates the threshold between perception and apperception. Anamorphic vision as I outlined it is not a matter of adjusting one&rsquo;s spectatorial position so as to correct perspective. Rather, it is the recognition of the impossibility of bringing simultaneously into view all of the material states of the text. The splash page for <em>Hypermarks</em> was designed to reflect all of this thinking, with the lines &ldquo;hypertext does not/ and indeed cannot/ attain a perfect realization&rdquo; fading to a blur. Such was my wry commentary on incompleteness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	But what would it have meant for it to be complete? And how would I have recognized it as such? It cannot simply be that it would have required an official launch to bring it into being, a notice that claimed ownership of the project&rsquo;s idea, because by these practical measures of publication, <em>Hypermarks</em> was live and even then locatable by search (many artists and authors found the site and contacted me with queries, thanks, and corrections). A citational act, one that recognizes and credits, articulates a project as an actually existing entity, irrespective of its state of completion and its future versioning. But I know <em>Hypermarks</em> to be frozen in its &ldquo;middle state,&rdquo; and, by contrast, <em>Anthologies and Miscellanies</em> to be complete, simply because I never folded it into another project. <em>Anthologies and Miscellanies</em> eventually morphed in part into the more comprehensive &ldquo;The Anthologies Page,&rdquo; but <em>Hypermarks</em> was never incorporated into another. The idea behind the project was to a certain extent fulfilled by the <a href=""http://collection.eliterature.org/2/"">Electronic Literature Collections</a>, but there was no text or file transfer out of which the latter emerged. The legacy code of <em>Hypermarks</em>, in other words, did not formally give rise to a different project, one that would have in its materialization relegated <em>Hypermarks</em> to the status of a version and thereby given it a terminus. It disappeared from my record of professional activities at some point between my reviews in 2002 and 2004, but it lives on as potential. In fact it was the recognition of its &ldquo;middle state&rdquo; prompted by this special issue that may very well at some point lead to its reanimation.</p>

	<span _fck_bookmark=""1"" style=""display: none;"">&nbsp;</span>This GIF image is one of a series of diagrams I used in&nbsp; meetings with ITVS to explain how the WORLD WITHOUT OIL online game would work. These &ldquo;middle-state&rdquo; meetings took place in August through October of 2006. At that time, I had submitted a proposal to do WORLD WITHOUT OIL for ITVS, and they liked the core idea very much, and had been assured by consultant Jane McGonigal that its game principles were sound. But nothing like WWO had ever been done before, so we met and I laid out the game workings for critique. The &ldquo;Game Engine&rdquo; diagram is a visual aid to understanding WWO&rsquo;s most vital dynamic: <em>how people get attracted to the game, how they play, and how their play both deepens their engagement and attracts more people.</em></p>
<p>
	(Background on WORLD WITHOUT OIL: it was a landmark game, the first alternate reality game (ARG) about a serious issue. WWO pretended an oil shock had begun and invited everyone to file &ldquo;eyewitness reports&rdquo; about it at the citizen crisis nerve center, <a href=""http://worldwithoutoil.org/"">worldwithoutoil.org</a>. People played by imagining what their lives would be like with less oil, expressed in emails, voicemails, videos and so on. Each day&rsquo;s player stories laid the foundation for the next day&rsquo;s play. In 32 days the game amassed over 1,500 stories, creating a remarkably diverse, perceptive and affecting &ldquo;pre-enactment&rdquo; of our next oil crisis. You can read more <a href=""http://worldwithoutoil.org/metaabout.htm"">here</a>.)</p>
<p>
	You begin &ldquo;Game Engine&rdquo; in the upper right corner, where people discover WWO online and enter the flow by the green dot. They see stories freshly created by other citizens, written as though the crisis is real. The site encourages visitors to respond in kind (the paths flowing counterclockwise from the green dot). It invites them to create their own stories that build on the ones they&rsquo;ve just seen, using whatever communication method they&rsquo;re comfortable with.</p>
<p>
	Their creations are added to the site (lower left corner) and the gamemasters curate it and learn from it (upper left corner). When, for example, players described how the oil shortage was devastating tourism, the gamemasters adopted and amplified that theme. This update enriches and freshens the oil crisis narrative which attracts more viewers and the game engine enters another cycle (upper right corner again). Thus every morning WWO players woke up to find new developments in the crisis and a new opportunity to help elucidate or solve the problem.</p>
<p align=""center"">
	* * * * *</p>
<p>
	As a game designer, I struggle to communicate my game ideas to others. My games in particular defy easy 2D visualization, because they operate with a heavy narrative dimension, and both games and narratives are best understood as flows, not flat images. With WWO, I was also striving to create a new kind of game that &ldquo;complexifies itself&rdquo; via crowdsourcing &ndash; another difficult dynamic to convey.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Game Engine&rdquo; is not a diagram I would create for myself. It shows relationships and processes that I feel I know intuitively, plus for simplicity&rsquo;s sake it assumes all players follow a similar path. In actuality I feel my highest challenge as game designer is to appreciate players as a cloud of skills, motivations, play rhythms etc. and to construct a game that accommodates as much of that cloud as it can.</p>
<p>
	The astute observer may look at &ldquo;Game Engine&rdquo; and wonder: <em>where&rsquo;s the game?</em> The diagram might seem to describe interactive not-games such as YouTube and LiveJournal. This resemblance is intentional: at that time, those communities were the leading edge of social media. Video and blogger communities do not &ldquo;go in a direction,&rdquo; however; they have no overarching narrative and no curation toward a goal. By introducing these elements, I made WWO something that you <em>played</em>.</p>
<p>
	As &ldquo;Game Engine&rdquo; indicates, WWO didn&rsquo;t <em>seem</em> like a game.&nbsp; This was quite intentional. First, I wanted to make sure WWO was inviting to non-gamers. Second, I wanted players to focus on the story, not game mechanics. Third, alternate reality games are famous for using &ldquo;TINAG&rdquo; (&ldquo;This Is Not A Game&rdquo;) as a device to heighten immersion in their stories &ndash; by believing its own fiction, the game helps players get inside the fiction too. I wanted WWO to excel in this regard.</p>
<p>
	The astute observer may also look at &ldquo;Game Engine&rdquo; and ask: <em>how come it says nothing about oil?</em> Truth is, WORLD WITHOUT OIL was not actually about oil or the lack thereof. As a public media non-profit, ITVS strives to broadcast stories from people who don&rsquo;t usually get the chance to be heard. True to this mission, WWO focused on&nbsp; getting people to share their stories, especially individuals and communities that media typically overlooks (see the box at the center of the diagram). Oil dependency plays an essential role as a narrative driver of that sharing, but as &ldquo;Game Engine&rdquo; reveals by absence, oil is not the game&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>
	If you&rsquo;ve read this far, you may want to know the end of the diagram&rsquo;s story &ndash; i.e., did the game engine work? Yes, remarkably well. One reviewer noted:</p>
<p>
	<strong>As a concerned citizen I am glad to see the &quot;game for good&quot; aspect of World Without Oil get a lot of airtime. As a student of game design, I see something far more fascinating going on: World Without Oil appears to be one of the most efficient content propagating narratives ever executed in an Alternate Reality Game context.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MARK HEGGEN &ndash; RE:TEXT</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;An efficient content propagating narrative&rdquo; is exactly what we set out to make.</p>
<p>
	Thank you, MediaCommons, for the impetus to relive some of WWO&rsquo;s formative moments and the opportunity to preserve a key moment of its middle-state history.&nbsp; &ndash;&nbsp;KE</p>

	This page is a fake version of a script template I&rsquo;m using at the moment for my project AUTHENTIC IN ALL CAPS. Since the project isn&rsquo;t released yet, I don&rsquo;t want to reveal storylines! So I&rsquo;ve replaced pertinent details for now, and will replace it with the actual script after launch. Although it may look like a normal film or television script, it isn&rsquo;t. This script, like the project, is the result of years of exploration and experimentation with documentation practices in transmedia. Transmedia (and other terms with the same meaning), describes projects that encompass a variety of distinct touch-points or media. In this project, it encompasses various fictional websites, mini-games, and mobile apps.</p>
<p>
	<strong>About the project</strong></p>
<p>
	AUTHENTIC IN ALL CAPS is a playful story experienced through an Internet app, using a unique combination of audio to drive traversal across fictional websites. Imagine putting headphones on at your computer, clicking on the app and opening up the introductory website. You hear a narrator, chatting about the site you see, and you&rsquo;re encouraged to take a journey across numerous fictional websites and hear a story unfold.</p>
<p>
	The use of audio to guide the player of this tale is an experiment in &ldquo;game approachability&rdquo;: the practice of &ldquo;making games initially more fun, friendly, and accessible to players who have the desire to play, yet do not always follow through to actually playing the game&rdquo; (Desurvire and Wiberg 131). Although AUTHENTIC is more a playful story than a game, the principle of approachability is just as pertinent in transmedia. The majority of people experience only a portion of dispersed works &ndash; whether they&rsquo;re dispersed across the web or across distinct media platforms. As I&rsquo;ve <a href=""http://www.argn.com/2011/10/prepare_yourself_for_christy_denas_new_audio_drama_authentic_in_all_caps/"" target=""_blank"">explained elsewhere</a>, I&rsquo;m drawing on audio tour design to help make dispersed experience more approachable. But I&rsquo;m also keen to explore what could be called documentation approachability.</p>

14803,"contributed_pieces",5652,"Writing with Sound",1,1335283152,1344019701,2,5652,14711,"<p>
	I have a rather ambivalent relationship with sound. For one, I enjoy listening to music and playing the drums. Both are hobbies for me. And when I&rsquo;m listening to a record or playing a set, my intent is to be as uncritical as possible&mdash;to assume and even embrace all of the stereotypes common to sonic culture: immersion in an affective experience, &ldquo;feeling it&rdquo; over &ldquo;thinking it,&rdquo; and improvising instead of outlining. I know all of these stereotypes are bunk. Music is at once an intellectual and affective endeavor, and for many academics it is an object of inquiry. Still, when I write about sound, I often want these stereotypes to hold true. Among other things, I struggle with translating the complexities of what I hear into writing. &ldquo;There is simply too much going on here to capture.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sucking all of the energy from it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Words don&rsquo;t do it justice.&rdquo; Sure, I&rsquo;ve felt the same way when writing about novels or poetry. But the thing is, I can at least quote, scan, or photocopy a print text. I can make parts of it co-present with my criticism. In the history of humanities scholarship, doing the same with audio is difficult at best. Not only are print monographs and journal articles still par for the course; they are also some of the very mechanisms through which scholarly practices are naturalized and measured. My fingers are crossed that such standards and mechanisms are changing.</p>
<p>
	In the meantime, I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with a platform architected specifically for multimodal scholarly communication. Called Scalar, it&rsquo;s a project of the Alliance for Networking Visual Culture (which is working to put the platform in the wild). Scholars including Alex Juhasz and Virginia Kuhn have already published with it, and I&rsquo;m using it to compose a cultural history of magnetic recording. At first, I was excited that Scalar would easily allow me to publish scholarship complete with audio on the web. Audiences could finally hear what I was writing about. However, as I continued to compose with Scalar, I quickly learned that it sparks a curious set of demands, namely concerns about how to write <em>with </em>sound instead of merely <em>about</em> it. Below is an example of what I mean, and it includes screen shots of my Scalar project. Since this cluster of the <em>The New Everyday </em>is titled <em>Rough Cuts</em>, I found it only fitting to select samples from my work on William S. Burroughs&rsquo;s cut-up experiments.</p>
<p>
	Here is how I normally write about audio and use it as a form of evidence:</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 1: Screenshot of a Paragraph in Scalar</p>
<p>
	This approach is ideal for print, and it lends itself nicely to sequential argumentation.</p>
<p>
	Initially, adding an audio clip (e.g., an excerpt of Burroughs&rsquo;s &ldquo;Origin and Theory of the Tape Cut-Ups&rdquo;) to this approach did not dramatically alter my writing. Rather, I put the file to the right of the text, ideally next to or near the sounds I was referencing. In the shot below, I am specifically quoting Burroughs saying: &ldquo;When you cut into the present, the future leaks out.&rdquo; With the multimodal interface, audiences can hear that sentence in the context of his April 1976 lecture at the Naropa Institute.</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 2: Screenshot of a Paragraph and Audio in Scalar</p>
<p>
	I then started to realize that, when the audio is co-present with my writing, I create some redundancies, which could be cut from my paragraphs. For instance, audiences do not necessarily need to read, &ldquo;Here, he is referring to when he cut an article by J. Paul Getty . . .&rdquo; After all, they can hear Burroughs saying this explicitly in the audio file.</p>
<p>
	I also began experimenting with where else the audio could be placed. Should it follow the linear logic of the paragraph? Should I insert it into the paragraph itself, rather than in the margins? With these questions in mind, here is one arrangement that emerged:</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 3: Screenshot of a Paragraph and Audio in Scalar</p>
<p>
	Using the &ldquo;history editor&rdquo; in Scalar, I can see the effects of my revisions. Version 10 (time-stamped 09:19, 07 October 2011) is 201 characters longer than Version 12 (time-stamped 09:33, 07 October 2011). At least at this juncture, it seems that writing with sound means less writing. Or at least less description.</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 4: Screenshot of the History Editor in Scalar</p>
<p>
	However, my earlier point about reducing redundancies in the text brought me to consider how annotations linked to the audio itself could be an effective way of providing some historical context for Burroughs&rsquo;s talk. For instance, during the talk he refers to &ldquo;one of Getty&rsquo;s sons.&rdquo; Yet he never names the son. As shown below, I can include an annotation explaining which of Getty&rsquo;s sons did in fact sue him, not to mention when, where, and for how much.</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 5: Screenshot of a Paragraph, Audio, and an Annotation in Scalar</p>
<p>
	One issue with this approach&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s necessarily a problem&mdash;is that the annotations tend to pop-up and cover my primary text. That is, the addition of an annotation layer in the interface too easily distracts audiences from the argument I am making. And so I began porting the argument itself more directly into the listening experience. Consider these three examples:</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">

	Figure 8: Screenshot of Audio and an Annotation in Scalar</p>
<p>
	As audiences listen to Burroughs&rsquo;s talk, they can now follow my argument about it. Here, not only does the temporality of my argument morph (e.g., audiences lose some agency over the pace and place of their reading). The space and form of interpretation morphs, too. Paragraphs shift to snippets, which pop-up and disappear depending on how I&rsquo;ve tagged and annotated the audio file.</p>
<p>
	And once my argument is synced with an audio file in this fashion, I can entirely rethink my initial, paragraph-based approach to writing about sound. The argument now looks like this:</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 9: Screenshot of Audio in Scalar</p>
<p>
	Visualized this way, audiences can quickly see the date and location of the talk, as well as the title track (&ldquo;Origin and Theory of the Tape Cut-Ups&rdquo;) and album (<em>Break Through in Grey Room</em>) from which the excerpt is drawn. This version, Version 14 (time-stamped 10:21, 07 October 2011), is 1923 characters shorter than Version 10 (pictured as Figure 1 above).</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 10: Screenshot of the History Editor in Scalar</p>
<p>
	I can also view the media file in Scalar and see my annotations listed in order of appearance. The image below only shows a few annotations, but it gives a sense of how the paragraph can be distributed and spatialized through the temporal logic of the audio file.</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 11: Screenshot of Audio and Annotations in Scalar</p>
<p>
	However, neither this image nor the difference in characters (i.e., 96 in Version 14 and 2019 in Version 10) means that electronic text becomes less important (even after redundancies are cut) in a multimodal, networked environment. Instead, the writing is granulated and exists in horizontal relationships with all other media in the project. Consequently, each annotation becomes a unique instance&mdash;a snippet of text with its own metadata, URL, and relations. Here is an example of one snippet in isolation:</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 12: Screenshot of an Annotation in Scalar</p>
<p>
	Such granularity becomes useful when visualizing the content of an entire project and the relationships within it. For instance, in the image below, all of the media files (i.e., audio, images, and video) in my project are visualized in Scalar.</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 13: Screenshot of a Media Visualization in Scalar</p>
<p>
	The green dots represent media files; the purple dots, annotations; and the orange dots, pages. I can see that, at least for now, four portions of my excerpt of &ldquo;Origin and Theory of the Tape Cut-Ups&rdquo; have been annotated, and two pages include or reference the excerpt. This visualization begs the question of what a page or an annotation implies, especially when everything in Scalar is essentially a unique instance that can relate to anything else. For now, I am inclined to say an annotation is a critical commentary on a specific slice of media (e.g., audio), and a page is a collection of (or a folder for) those annotations. Within Scalar, I can then visualize the relations of these snippets with the balance of the project:</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 14: Screenshot of a Radial Visualization in Scalar</p>
<p>
	This radial visualization is comparable to an index. With it, I can see that &ldquo;we had no explanation for this at the time&rdquo; is only mentioned once during the project, as an annotation of &ldquo;Origin and Theory of the Tape Cut-Ups,&rdquo; which is referenced in the page, &ldquo;Cutting into the Present.&rdquo; I can also see that &ldquo;Origin and Theory&rdquo; is tagged as an audio file; however, it is one among other audio files (seven, to be exact) in the project. As the project progresses and becomes more robust, this kind of emergent index will feed back into my writing, giving me an opportunity to express a network through processes impossible without a computer.</p>
<p>
	All of this work is indeed in progress, and I&rsquo;m still not sure whether syncing my arguments with audio files is the approach I prefer. I have also realized that, when granulating their projects, writers need to follow clear workflows and procedures in order to test an array of options. It is not all improvisation.</p>
<p>
	So, am I positive that a radial view of my project affords audiences any new information about the history of magnetic audio? Have I spelled out how, exactly, scholarly communications might benefit from networking electronic text, audio, and other media through many-to-many relations? Or have I explored ways that my multimodal project can be more accessible to multiple audiences, including those who may not be able to hear or navigate the sounds I&rsquo;m writing about? No, and not yet. But I hope to have responses soon.</p>
<p>
	For now, what I am learning from writing <em>with</em> sound is that, when composing with platforms like Scalar, scholars are practically provoked into speculation&mdash;into conjecturing with the multimodal forms of the data-driven web. A somewhat unfamiliar territory for the humanities, we might call this situation an ambivalent blend of thinking and feeling (including feelings of bewilderment, frustration, surprise, serendipity, confusion, and curiosity). Right now, that&rsquo;s certainly not a bad middle-state to be in.</p>

Hopefully when I&rsquo;ve finished school, I&rsquo;ll have the time to start it back up, as the condition which inspired the strip still exists: there is only one regular archives webcomic (Goldman), and while libraries and museums show up in many comics expos, archives rarely do.

	This .jpg is a screenshot of my Adobe Illustrator &ldquo;inspiration workspace&rdquo;, a draft created in the process of redesigning the<em>Arcane Gallery of Gadgetry</em> (<em>AGOG</em>) site. <em>AGOG</em> is an educational narrative alternate reality game (ARG) with steampunk, Civil War, and time travel thematics (http://www.ArcaneGalleryOfGadgetry.org for more on the ARG); the redesign attempts to more obviously separate visitors seeking an entry into the ARG from those wishing to read about the research study behind the ARG&mdash;in ARG parlance, drawing a line between the TINAG (&ldquo;This Is Not A Game&rdquo;) and the TIAG.</p>
<p>
	For web design projects that draw strongly on some sort of literary narrative for inspiration (what I think of as &ldquo;narrative-based&rdquo; web design), I like to use Illustrator to pull all my digital inspiration resources into one workspace. I didn&rsquo;t intend this .ai file to turn into a wireframe or mock-up, and under ordinary circumstances I&rsquo;d never share it with anyone else; it&rsquo;s simply a step between the process of doodling notes in a sketchbook and creating a mock-up of the final site to share with design clients. An amalgamation of inspirational sources like this generally never sees an audience, whereas the next step mock-ups <em>are</em> produced with an audience in mind, even as they&rsquo;re at the same time technically drafts.</p>
<p>
	This file is as much a space defined by absence as by presence. Sketches and list of keywords framing the site&rsquo;s eventual look exist separately, on a large sketchpad propped on the wall behind my desk. My paper sketches deal more with the macro (e.g. layout blocking) or micro (e.g. logos), levels of design meriting their own .ai files; the inspiration workspace pulls together just those design elements that are difficult to plan using paper and pencil. It usually isn&rsquo;t worthwhile to type my pencilled notes into the workspace file, since I&rsquo;m now at the stage of playing around with those ideas in visual form; for example, &ldquo;looks like an actual shelf or desk with appropriate objects on it&rdquo; is translated here into the inclusion of reference images for objects and shelves. In addition to such beginning-state drafts, absent also is anything in the &ldquo;artboard&rdquo;, the bordered space at the workspace&rsquo;s center. For this kind of design work, I like to keep that area free for experimenting with pulling different images together, and later pull the site wireframe that exists in a separate .ai file into this space.</p>
<p>
	Whether it uses Adobe Illustrator or not, gathering web design inspiration is a curatorial process: think of choosing the items in an exhibit to create a desired visual effect. There&rsquo;s even a dark archive component! In this stage of the process, I pull in everything relevant, from creative-commons-licensed photographs to screenshots to closely copyrighted images; these latter have a place in the creation of the site&rsquo;s mood, though they&rsquo;re not used in the final public product.</p>
<p>
	Although I almost always visually chunk Illustrator space into themed areas (e.g. color palettes and font examples are separate from possible featured images), I usually don&rsquo;t go quite as far as dividing inspirational images into thematic areas, as I did with this workspace. Most projects don&rsquo;t require so many irreconcilable inspirational sources (e.g. I didn&rsquo;t plan to include all the maps, or all the photographs of historical figures). In the case of <em>AGOG</em>, it was clear I couldn&rsquo;t use everything I&rsquo;d flagged as a possible inspirational image, and separating my workspace into categories helped me make certain I included something from each area:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	1. <em>Background material </em>(bottom)<em>. </em>Textures, frames, and visual organizational ideas such as shelves.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	2. <em>Collage objects </em>(left). One design possibility was to create a page that replicates a physical space such as a desk or shelf. While the main images here would be illustrations of <em>AGOG</em>&rsquo;s key artifacts (such as the &ldquo;kairograph&rdquo; a spiritual telegraph), in the workspace I started to collect relevant items that might make the space look more real (e.g. compasses).</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	3. <em>Historical inspiration </em>(top). This area includes images of historical characters who have a place in the game&rsquo;s narrative (Clara Barton, Ellis Spear, Benjamin Franklin, and Walt Whitman) as well as resources relating to the game&rsquo;s steampunk/invention motif (e.g. the patent for a mechanical duck).</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	4. <em>Images from the first season of the ARG </em>(right). These serve as a reminder of the game&rsquo;s narrative and for also may be worked into the current design.</p>
<p>
	This workspace helped me keep the new design in line with the previous one; I pulled from inspirational images used in other <em>AGOG</em> sites, such as Victorian etchings, and I tried to hold inspirational images to a color palette that works well with antiqued paper (since <em>AGOG</em> uses aged historical documents such as patents and maps as major game components). I continued to add and remove images until the effect of the amassed visuals felt correct, regardless of which of the pieces would actually be used in the final work: the goal was to create a rough visual expression of the ideas behind the game, before translating that expression into a final site mock-up.</p>
<p>
	As I mentioned, this design draws on a literary narrative for inspiration: the mythology of <em>AGOG</em>. I&rsquo;m both a web designer and a literature scholar with interests in editorial theory, so I&rsquo;m keenly interested in how narratives are translated into web design, whether that means choices about the structure of an online scholarly edition or, as here, the look of a site based on a textual artifact. Too often, the web design of a digital scholarly production is treated as a post-critical activity, when in fact visual rhetoric makes a huge impact on how we interpret written data&mdash;and I suspect it&rsquo;s in middle-state artifacts like this workspace draft that we might begin to trace and prove a methodology of narrative-based web design.</p>
<p>
	Drawing an analog between textual editing and literary web design processes is tricky; where the underpinnings of the textual side of an editorial project are often part of a publicly released methodology, editors release the arguments and decisions feeding into the visual design of a scholarly edition far less often. Perhaps introducing a clearer drafting process for narrative-based web design, one that moves from inspirational sources to the final visual product and results in a written design methodology, might be a path toward witnessing connections between design elements their textual inspiration.</p>

	Bunker Hill: &quot;old town, lost town, shabby town, crook town&quot; (Raymond Chandler, <em>The High Window</em>) lay one steep block above the upscale downtown streets of Los Angeles. Graced with Queen Anne-style mansions first built for local aristocrats, by the 1950s it evolved into a low-income community housing pensioners, low-paid workers and Bohemians. Pressure from civic reformers and real-estate developers forced the Hill&#39;s destruction beginning in 1955. Today a flattened Bunker Hill is covered with highrise apartments and office buildings, museums and cultural venues, including the Walt Disney Concert Hall. None of the old structures remain.</p>
<p>
	Pre-redevelopment images of Bunker Hill reveal a neighborhood filled with grandiose houses wreathed in abundant southern California vegetation, often in spectacular stages of decay and romantic ruin. Its streetscapes are richly detailed with antiquated commercial signage and obsolete infrastructure. Arguably a posterchild for Los Angeles&#39;s constant self-reinvention, Bunker Hill&#39;s story exemplifies the indivisibility of renewal and destruction, embodying an idea that circulated in many cities with conspicuous reservoirs of poverty: that we must forcibly treat an acutely diseased organism by excising its offending parts. Reviled in its time, it now functions as a case study of how historical consciousness is fed by absence and loss. Overall its landscape is a real-life analogue for the fictional world of post-World War II film noir, and in fact the Hill was the venue for many noir location shoots.</p>

	This six-minute sequence containing three separate takes is a &quot;process plate,&quot; made to be projected on a background screen as part of a film shot taking place in a car, train or ship, or possibly behind a running person or galloping horse. You may remember seeing conversations taking place in a taxi, out of whose window we see an out-of-focus, fuzzy street going by. But the three plates on this roll are far from indistinct -- they&#39;re locked-down, rock-steady, razor-sharp long takes recording incidental American landscape scenes that might never have otherwise been captured. This particular clip comes from an unknown Columbia feature from the noir era, and is one of a number of plates shot around Los Angeles. I don&#39;t yet know for what movie this segment was shot, but the blogosphere has spoken and concluded that it was shot in 1947. One viewer even glimpsed her father, and when her sighting was called too good to be true, substantiated it with a birth certificate scan showing she was born at the address where the man in question stands.</p>
<p>
	Ever focused on economy, Hollywood studios saved much of the material they shot but didn&#39;t use in finished films. Studios and independent producers built large stock footage libraries containing generic footage (in which no name actors were seen) that they imagined might be suitable for use in future productions. Only a small percentage of this material was ever used, and most of it has never been seen. But what transpired to be useless for the studios has, without premeditation or plan, acquired retrospective value, because process plates function as deeply thick depictions of place and time. As stock footage, they possess potential to inflect new productions with accurate historical evidence, and are sometimes used this way. But I&#39;m more interested in the potential they offer when reused as found objects by themselves.</p>
<p>
	I&#39;ve remarked <a href=""http://blackoystercatcher.blogspot.com/2009/06/taking-history-back-from-storytellers.html"">elsewhere</a> on the endemic tendency to overnarrativize in current documentary.<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a> It strikes me that focusing on unpublished, intermediate documents not necessarily intended for use in their existing form gives makers opportunities to escape the suite of tired tropes that risk-averse distributors tend to prefer. Home movies offer one such opportunity; process plates another. Movement in space can be an alluring means of simulating travel in time. However enigmatic or aimless, process plates imply a journey that the spectator&#39;s mind jumps to decrypt and complete. And while they effectively inventory the landscape from a fixed point of view, the viewer&#39;s eye is constantly caught between center and periphery in an urgent attempt to catch and assimilate all the detail there is to be seen before it passes. What might seem to be little more than an empty shot out an automobile window instead becomes a desperate tease; we hope to see as much as we can of a vanished place/time before it disappears.</p>
<p>
	The process plates in this collection range widely through the 1930s-1950s American landscape. They contain riveting imagery of the Los Angeles urban core; the San Fernando Valley as an agricultural zone modulated by embryonic, cheap roadside businesses on the boulevards; industrial Chicago, Philadelphia and the Bronx seen from trains; the Midwestern farm belt; views of pre-freeway New York and San Francisco; and much more yet to be discovered. Their reuse potential would seem great, but they&#39;re seldom used. In part this is due to the steep license fees their custodians charge (soon to change, as Internet Archive begins to offer a collection for free use), but I&#39;d argue their lack of use is prompted principally by mediamakers&#39; reluctance to let images speak for themselves. Archival images are typically presented in bits and pieces, sweetened by immersive music and sound effects or contextualized by narration so as to remove ambiguity. While we pay constant tribute to archives as preservers of history, we rarely look at original, unmediated materials. It would be unfair, however, not to point to one striking exception: the wide reception of the 1906 film <em><a href=""http://www.archive.org/details/TripDownMarketStreetrBeforeTheFire"">A Trip Down Market Street Before the Fire</a></em>.<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a> Especially after its exposure on <em>60 Minutes</em>, this film seems to be serving as a kind of public induction into the richness of unedited archival material, and it&#39;s a rare example of a film that&#39;s leapt from the rarefied territory of silent-film scholarship into a populist classic.</p>
<p>
	In general, though, I&#39;d argue that the wide gap between potential and actual uses of the archival record speaks to its simultaneous urgency and irrelevancy. Archives often seem like a first-aid kit or a rusty tool, resources that we find reassuring but rarely use. More generally, the existence of archives is bolstered by a consensus that they&#39;re important (which I&#39;d argue is faith-based), but their value isn&#39;t confirmed by use. Not only unspoken but fragile, this consensus is unlikely to survive an era of externally imposed austerity unless archives find ways to defend the specificity and importance of their endeavors. As we slide into an era of historical simultaneity, as new and old images recombine and propagate through the culture, it becomes more difficult to understand how the specificity of the historical record helps us to contextualize the present and future. Archival enclosure is no option if archives are to survive. Perhaps pushing documents like this clip back into the public sphere can remind us that invisibility is not either.</p>

	Although electronic devices increasingly pervade our daily activities, the process from which these devices are conceived, refined, and finally produced is largely opaque, even if one peers behind the casing of the device and views the electronic components within. The intermediate stage artifact I am submitting is a photograph of a printed circuit board (PCB) (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). This particular PCB was used to prototype a novel electronic reading device created for my research about how such devices would fit into the reading activities of academics and knowledge workers. The completed reading device is a thin slate, similar in appearance to an Amazon Kindle DX, or Apple iPad, with an E-Ink electronic paper display (like that found on the black and white Kindles) (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). My goal with this artifact is to show that the process of creating electronics hardware probably has more in common with the other projects featured in the middle state collection than one might initially think. Multiple iterative cycles during which ideas are tested, and problems get fixed, and designs get refined all factor prominently into the creation of electronic hardware. Of course, the unique perspective I hope to contribute is how these iterations are achieved when it comes to electronics hardware.</p>

<p>
	As with any large project, an essential technique for maintaining one&rsquo;s sanity is to break the task into smaller, more manageable pieces. For electronics and software, it is much faster to diagnose and fix problems when the system is restricted in complexity. The PCB seen here is one such mini-prototype that allowed me to test a design for the graphics system of the reading device in isolation.</p>
<p>
	The main purpose of the circuit board was to make sure my design for conveying signals from a microprocessor to the electronic paper display was valid. As one of the most basic requirements for a reading device is the ability to show text and images on the electronic screen, this portion of the project was the critical point where a tangled mass of integrated circuits and other electronic components would first start to resemble a reading device.</p>
<p>
	Rather than get into the technical details about how the PCB works, it is far more interesting to talk about what happens when things do not work. Like most endeavors, the first run of a hardware prototype is far from perfect. Problems include wires that are connected to the wrong chip, bad math, incorrect assumptions about the electrical behavior of a circuit and, most frustrating, problematic interactions between components that only occur in a specific design. Thus begins the process of fixing the design to make it right.</p>
<p>
	The main challenge associated with revising a circuit design is that it ultimately means that the circuit board itself needs to change. For reasons of time and money (mostly time, as getting a new circuit board made and shipped out takes half a week at the quickest, not to mention the time needed to solder the different components onto the board), various techniques have developed to iterate one&#39;s design while minimizing the need to have new boards created. The photo of my PCB illustrates two of these techniques: &quot;green-wiring&quot; and banks of unpopulated components.</p>
<p>
	Green-wiring is the electronics equivalent of the editor&#39;s red pen. The term arises from the fact that historically these wires were green to help the wires blend in with the board, as back then, the costs of re-fabricating a PCB were prohibitive. When a part of the circuit does not work as planned, one can correct it by cutting away the wires printed on the board and then routing around the mistake using additional wires. Examples of green-wiring on the board include the thin blue wires to stabilize the power going to the display. A more visible use of this technique are the black and red wires that were used to add a comically-large power jack to the board after I discovered I had neglected to provide the screen with the correct voltage, and needed to obtain it from an external AC adapter. The art of green-wiring involves identifying the best locations to cut existing lines (generally where they are thinnest, and furthest way from other wires to minimize any collateral damage), and finding locations where it is feasible to attach the new wire (generally somewhere with a large enough piece of exposed metal to which the wire can be soldered &ndash; metallic contacts of board components are popular locations as seen in the photo).</p>
<p>
	The other technique visible on the board is the inclusion of alternative, backup circuit designs, which are left unpopulated with components. The careful eye will notice that there are spaces on the upper right corner of the board (by the labels R3, R4, U$10 and U$11) for electronics components that are not present. Since the cost of a circuit board does not change based on how many wires and spaces for components are printed on the board, using empty space on a board for alternative versions of a circuit allows designers to hedge their designs. If one is unsure about a design, many different candidates can be placed on one board. Should the first design not work, components can be placed into the alternative circuit to see if it performs better. For this board, I had two designs for the circuit that would power up the display and also reset it due to fact that the procedures provided in the display manufacturer&#39;s specifications were somewhat ambiguous about this topic.</p>
<p>
	Once the problems had been identified and the changes applied to this board, the digital schematic of the board was updated to incorporate the corrections much like how editing marks on paper might be transferred into a master word processor document. Additional functionality to test would was added, a new board was created and the process began anew.</p>
<p>
	I end with a complementary photo (<strong>Figure 3</strong>), which is a camera phone photo I took in 2008, when the necessary adjustments and corrections described above had been made. This photo shows the processor successfully showing an image on the display using the prototype board.</p>

	Place and stories have had an intimate kinship since narrative forms first emerged. As Nick Kaye writes in the introduction to his book <em>Site-Specific Art: Performance, Place and Documentation</em>, &ldquo;If one accepts the proposition that the meanings of utterances, actions and events are affected by their &lsquo;local position&rsquo;, by the <em>situation </em>of which they are a part, then a work of art, too, will be defined in relation to its place and position&rdquo; (1). This resonates true for oral narratives&rsquo; place-based nature (and association with the space of the community of listeners), the &ldquo;durable&rdquo; narratives carved into stone to chronicle the meaning of a site, and more ephemeral forms that utilize an alternative storytelling platforms like graffiti. In each example of an emerging storytelling platform, the indelible relationship between a story and its space is significant.</p>
<p>
	For me, the use of mobile media for storytelling seemed especially effective for capturing and experiencing this intimate relationship between narrative and place. These media are location aware, they can easily capture audio and text, and are currently the most pervasive computing form worldwide. Unlike prior media for storytelling, mobile and locative media can layer an almost innumerable number of stories onto a single site.</p>
<p>
	Yet, as I started to explore the options for storytelling with mobile devices in 2009 and 2010, there weren&rsquo;t any tools or applications that were able to accomplish what I had hoped to do with my students. I wanted my students to create site-specific fictional stories, walking tours, histories, or games. The available options included getting my students to find ways to creatively mis-use existing mobile media tools and apps like <a href=""http://www.geocaching.com/"">geocaching</a> (placing printed out stories in geocache containers), <a href=""http://yellowarrow.net"">Yellow Arrow</a> or QR code stickers that would unlock text messages or websites, or even using <a href=""http://foursquare.com/"">Foursquare</a> by adding narrative elements in the &ldquo;Tips&rdquo; section of a location. None of these options seemed ideal and, in collaboration with a Computer Science undergraduate, Chris Simmons, I decided to build my own storytelling app called StoryMarker.</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	<a href=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/storymarker_figure-1b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/storymarker_figure-1b.preview.jpg"" /></a><br />
	<span class=""caption""><strong>Figure 1</strong>:&nbsp;Mockup of the home screen for the StoryMarker app, designed in January 2010 by Jason Farman. These mockups were transformed into the live app that ran on a few iPhones in early 2010.</span></p>
<p>
	The primary functionality for this app would be to record an audio story and attach it to a place by geotagging its coordinates (inspired by similar projects like Blast Theory&rsquo;s <a href=""http://www.blasttheory.co.uk/bt/work_rider_spoke.html""><em>Rider Spoke</em></a> and the Toronto-based <a href=""http://murmurtoronto.ca/""><em>[murmur]</em></a> project). As users of StoryMarker wandered past a location where a story was recorded, the app would alert them that a story was available in their vicinity. All stories would be audio-only in the first launch of the app and all stories would be available only if the listeners were standing in the spot where the story was recorded.</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	<a href=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/storymarker_figure-3.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/storymarker_figure-3.preview.jpg"" /></a><br />
	<span class=""caption""><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Mockup of the list view of the StoryMarker app, showing which stories were nearby to the user.</span></p>
<p>
	The motivation for these two limitations were debated quite a bit with the student I was working with and a faculty member in the Department of Art, <a href=""http://www.noprogram.org/"">Doug Gast</a>, who consulted with us on the project. From my perspective, the use of audio created an interesting relationship with the medium of the phone as a storytelling device: the app would utilize oral storytelling, which historically required proximity and synchronicity in order to be successful. Listeners to an oral narrative had to be in the same location at the same time. While we maintained the importance of mutual location, by dislocating the need for synchronous engagement, listeners build a deep sense of community and spatial relationships across asynchronous time.</p>
<p>
	This design choice complemented the continuing trend of using mobile phones for asynchronous connection between people through texting and email communication. This trend hit its nexus in 2009, as we began working through the planning stages for the project, when cellphones worldwide were used more for data transfer than for realtime voice communication (Wortham). Asynchronicity had become the dominant form of engagement and we wanted to explore some of the ways that this form of interaction can develop a deep sense of community and connection to a particular place.</p>
<p>
	In conjunction with this choice was the decision to &ldquo;lock&rdquo; all of the stories unless the participant was standing within proximity to the coordinates of the story. Part of this was an issue of motivation (i.e., how do we actually get people to walk to the place that this story is about?). By turning it into a game-like exploration of the stories of a place &mdash; like geocaching for narratives &mdash; we hoped that the need to hunt down the coordinates of a story would serve to motivate people to locate the place where the story was recorded. This was inspired by my own love of geocaching and the way that locative games can thoroughly transform the sense and purpose of a place.</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">

	<span class=""caption""><strong>Figure 3</strong>: Mockup of the map interface for the StoryMarker app. Pressing on a marker icon would open up a title and description of the story recorded in that location. Moving within proximity to the story would unlock the story for listeners.</span></p>
<p>
	While the motivating factors were very important in this decision to lock the stories unless a person was at the location, the larger reason for doing so was that, ultimately, we believed that the story would be incomplete without the environment as the setting of for the story. For me, the driving question was, &ldquo;What does site-specificity bring to the narrative experience?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The answers to that question continue to be far more complex than I had anticipated. Initially, I had conceived of the relationship between the stories and the spaces as one of context and narrative backdrop. The stories would play off of a site&rsquo;s context (e.g., in my students&rsquo; projects they used sites such as the university, a graveyard, and a nuclear reactor once associated with the Manhattan Project) and also utilize it as a backdrop, much in the same way a performance might utilize scene design to enact a sense of realism.</p>
<p>
	Yet, this answer simplifies the process of narrative, context, and site-specificity. My understanding of the relationship between these terms continues to fluctuate as my definition of them develops. While I have attempted to address the relationship between these categories in a more thorough way in my book, <a href=""http://www.mobileinterfacetheory.com""><em>Mobile Interface Theory</em></a>, I am aware that the interdependent nature of narrative, context, and site-specificity is rooted in a long genealogy that I am only beginning to trace.</p>
<p>
	As we considered these relational aspects of site-specific narrative for our app, it was also clear that these aspects were not only developed between the stories of the space and the media to tell those stories, but also the increasing significance we give the stories told by those in our networks. Thus, we realized that we needed to include a social component to the app. People would want to be able to filter the stories in a site based on those left by people in their network.</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, the StoryMarker app was never submitted to the Apple Store, in large part due to my relocation from Washington State to Maryland and Chris Simmons&rsquo; move to Japan. However, I still believe that the ideas driving the app are important in defining a significant, emerging way that our mobile devices are being used. Over the last couple of years since we designed StoryMarker, several apps have emerged with similar goals such as <a href=""http://broadcastr.com"">Broadcastr</a>, <a href=""http://7scenes.com/"">7scenes</a>, and <a href=""http://www.insydestory.com/"">InsydeStory</a>.</p>
<p>
	As I continue to think about this application and how it might develop and eventually launch, one thing that strikes me when I see my students&rsquo; explorations with similar apps is what I&rsquo;m currently terming the &ldquo;poverty of the screen&rdquo; for these narratives. The most compelling site-specific mobile narratives are those that get readers to interact with material objects in a meaningful way. The entirety of the story doesn&rsquo;t live strictly on the screen. Instead, the most dynamic mobile media narratives find a way to get readers to interact across the space of the screen with their immediate environment in a meaningful way. While this materiality can be enacted strictly through a digital device (a very material interface in numerous ways), this materiality needs to be compellingly highlighted in order to find a way for the narrative to move seamlessly across digital and physical spaces. This is one aspect that I continue to work through as I envision future forms that StoryMarker will take.</p>

	&ldquo;Middle-state&rdquo; forms in literary collections often reveal traces of people other than the primary author. A child&rsquo;s bright scribbles mixed with the pages of a manuscript draft suggest a writer whose creative process intersected with the lives of his children. An assistant&#39;s handwriting on the printout of a webpage hints at a collaborative research process. Often the person revealed is someone who has facilitated the author&rsquo;s writing life, and in doing so left her own deep imprint on the middle-state media and forms of a work.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Norman Mailer&rsquo;s working relationship with his long-time assistant Judith McNally provides a case in point. McNally assisted Mailer for nearly thirty years, and the <a href=""http://research.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/mailer.hp.html"">Norman Mailer Papers</a><strong>[link]</strong>at the Harry Ransom Center reflect their close collaboration. A proud Luddite, Mailer made it a &ldquo;point of honor&rdquo; not to use a computer.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a>Instead, he would handwrite or dictate a draft and give it to McNally for typing. McNally used a typewriter when she first started working for Mailer, and then transitioned to a computer in the mid- to late-1980s. When she finished a transcription, McNally would deliver the printout to Mailer, often via mail or fax. He would edit it and then return the marked-up copy to her. She would send him a clean copy that incorporated his changes, and then they would repeat the cycle.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	When McNally began working for Mailer in the late 1970s, her base of operations was an office on the ground floor of his apartment building in Brooklyn. After about ten years, she decided to work from her own home instead, just two blocks away. As Mailer got older and began spending more time in Provincetown, he and McNally relied more heavily on the fax machine and mail to exchange drafts. Throughout their working relationship they also talked on the phone an average of 25 to 50 times a week. &ldquo;We were communicators,&rdquo; Mailer explained in an interview I conducted with him in 2007. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had a relationship that was as intense, as narrow, as purposeful, as functional, and as removed as that.&rdquo; Mailer and McNally&rsquo;s way of working with each other remained essentially the same over the years, regardless of their physical proximity.<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a></p>

<p>
	The Ransom Center <a href=""http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/press/releases/2005/mailer.html"">purchased</a><strong>[link]</strong>Norman Mailer&rsquo;s papers for $2.5 million in 2005. Mailer donated a portion of that sum back to the Center to support the processing and upkeep of his materials. A team of two full-time archivists, two half-time archives assistants, and one work-study student spent two years cataloging his papers, which at over 1000 boxes constitute the largest single-author holding in the Center&rsquo;s collection.<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a><strong>[photo: redwine_stacks.jpg]</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The materials for the &ldquo;Bay of Pigs&rdquo; section of <em>Harlot&#39;s Ghost</em>, Mailer&rsquo;s 1991 novel chronicling the life of fictional CIA agent Harry Hubbard, illustrate the type of middle-state media and forms Mailer and McNally generated while producing a book. Research notes on index cards and a large, <a href=""https://webspace.utexas.edu/alicia36/MailerHarlotOutlineFullSize.jpg"">multi-colored organizational chart</a><strong>[link]</strong>, both in Mailer&rsquo;s distinctive scrawl, represent the book&rsquo;s early stages. Because of its size, the chart has been removed to flat file storage, where many of the Center&rsquo;s oversized paper items reside.</p>
<p>
	<strong>[2 photos side by side: redwine_cardbox.jpg and redwine_rehousedcards.jpg]</strong></p>
<p>
	The project archivists also transferred a tan metal index card box with &quot;Bay of Pigs&quot; written across the top in blood-red marker, to the Center&rsquo;s Personal Effects collection. The research note cards it contained were removed, labeled, and rehoused in an archival box alongside the bulk of Mailer&rsquo;s papers.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The Center&rsquo;s <em>Harlot&rsquo;s </em><em>Ghost</em> materials span 1985 to 1992. Bythe time Mailer dictated the &ldquo;Bay of Pigs&rdquo; section onto a series of five audio tapes in September 1989, he had transformed his initial research into a coherent plot summary. <strong>[photo: redwine_cassette.jpg] </strong>In one of the audio recordings, dated 16 September, Mailer clears his throat, we hear the rustle of a bag, he offers McNally some instructions, and then begins: &ldquo;We pick Harry up, still in Uruguay. He didn&rsquo;t get to Cuba quite so quickly as he thought, and in fact was held over until May...&rdquo; The cassettes themselves, which Mailer labeled in his own hand, have been assigned numbers and stored in document boxes in the Sound Recordings section of the stacks. The Center&rsquo;s Sound Recordings database<strong>[embed a link to this screenshot: redwine_soundrecdb.jpg]</strong>, which researchers can access in the reading room, provides descriptive metadata about the physical media, as well as a link to digitized versions of the original audio recordings.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The printout of McNally&rsquo;s earliest transcript for &quot;Bay of Pigs,&quot; dated 18 September, opens with the same words Mailer speaks on the audio tape: &ldquo;We pick Harry up, still in Uruguay&hellip;&rdquo; McNally wrote &ldquo;Harlot&rdquo; or &ldquo;HG&rdquo; on the labels of twenty-seven 5.25-inch floppy disks, yet none of them contains files for the opening pages of the &quot;Bay of Pigs&rdquo; section.<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""">[4]</a></p>
<p>
	<strong>[photo: redwine_disk.jpg]</strong></p>
<p>
	The Mailer Papers include over 400 disks and other digital media spanning approximately the mid-1980s to 2005. These items have been inventoried and recorded in the Center&rsquo;s internal Electronic Records database<strong>[embed a link to screenshot: redwine_erecdb.jpg]</strong> and now reside on shelves in my work space, near the machines I use to access the digital media in the Center&rsquo;s collection. Eventually, all digital media will be moved to a location in the stacks.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Although McNally&rsquo;s original disks and the digital files they contained are physically absent, the audio recordings and computer printouts suggest the disks&#39; original position in the progression of middle-state media. As the medium changed from cassette tape to digital to paper&mdash;with the &ldquo;digital to paper&rdquo; step reversing and repeating as McNally incorporated Mailer&rsquo;s handwritten corrections into her digital version and printed out fresh copy&mdash;Mailer continued to refine his language and the story. Echoes of the 16 September recording reverberate in the opening sentence of the published &ldquo;Bay of Pigs&rdquo; section: &quot;After Howard Hunt departed, I remained in Uruguay for several weeks and did not return to America until the beginning of May.&quot;<a href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title="""">[5]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<em>Harlot&rsquo;s Ghost</em> evolved from research notes, story charts, audio tapes, drafts, and digital files into a single, published book, but the archival materials related to the book are dispersed across different departments and floors throughout the Ransom Center. The archivists who processed Mailer&rsquo;s papers also created intermediary products in the course of their work. The content of some of these, such as the correspondence database we used to keep track of which letters were housed in which boxes<strong>[embed link to screenshot: redwine_corresdb.jpg]</strong>, was absorbed into the finished finding aid (see: <a href=""http://research.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/mailer.corr.html"">Index of Correspondents</a><strong>[link]</strong>), although the original format remains invisible to the general public. Other files and documents generated during processing initially served as internal references for staff&mdash;for example, a separation sheet marking the removal of an item to oversize storage&mdash;but also became permanent markers with information that helps guide researchers who come to use the materials. The finding aid itself went through several revisions before being finalized in three different forms: a Word document stored on one of the Center&rsquo;s servers, printouts filed in three different locations around the building, and an html version stored on a server and displayed online.<a href=""#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"" title="""">[6]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Literary archives and the finding aids that describe them represent layered networks of communication and collaboration. The middle-state media and forms within these holdings provide insight into a writer&#39;s creative process, reveal people like McNally whose work signficantly helped an author&#39;s literary production, and give a glimpse into the labor and interpretation that archivists undertake when organizing and describing a body of materials for use.</p>

	Envision a workshop atop a hill facing the ocean, a light breeze, ambient music, and a candle lit glow; now face your fears and release your innermost thoughts to a blank page that you will shortly read out loud to a group of strangers.&nbsp; It might seem scary at first, but this was how I began my studio notebook practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years ago in order to understand what my creative processes meant to me, I spent a week in Maine learning how to do proprioceptive writing and to use plain notebooks as a portable studio.&nbsp; There I learned to use a notebook to store my ideas before they became anything tangible.&nbsp; It was a strange and transformative experience that has followed me to this day.&nbsp; There were no rules on how to use your notebook, simply to work a little each day and devote time to your practice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	Below are some glimpses into my notebook studio, the work before the work: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	At first the pages seem arbitrary: fluffy fabric, torn pages, mud, and text filling the pages. But if you look deeper they all lead to some definitive idea that is unearthed from its pages.&nbsp; Is the art the notebook or is what comes from the book the art? The line is blurred and I see them as mirrors of one another.&nbsp; I often have ideas that sit with me for years and through my notebook I am able to revisit them and see where they may lead me.</p>

<p>
	Storytelling has been a lifelong interest for me. As a child I was fascinated with movies and literature.&nbsp; I would spend most weekends going to the movies to see anything from foreign films to Hollywood blockbusters.&nbsp; As an adult I studied film and photography, which eventually led me to interactive media.&nbsp; I was interested in finding ways to implant and embed stories into our everyday experiences; to blatantly reclaim the sense of wonder we often lose as adults.&nbsp; From this searching came the notion of embedding audio into threads.&nbsp; I wanted to find a way to embed or give the illusion of embedding audio into fabric and have it play stories of my childhood.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	Sonic Threads came out of those interests; the dress provides a way to share stories through touch and sound.&nbsp; When the embroidered threads on the dress are touched pre-recorded audio of children&rsquo;s fairy tale stories play through a set of speakers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	The images below show thoughts and designs that where not consciously linked but led me to the making of the storytelling dress. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>
	Sonic Threads began in my notebook and progressed to mini samples.&nbsp; Patterns are shown below:&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	The final design of the dress came from a pattern from the 1950s. The embroidery resembled sections of the stories they related to: a bear for Goldie Locks and the Three Bears, a wand for Cinderella, and a spinning circle for Rumpelstiltskin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	The prototype dress is shown below along with a short video.</p>

14854,"contributed_pieces",5638,"""Taroko Gorge"" Printout",1,1338952345,1343969044,2,5638,14711,"<p>
	My offering is <a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/taroko_gorge_in_python.preview.jpg"" target=""_blank"">a printout</a> of the first version of &ldquo;Taroko Gorge,&rdquo; a simple poetry generator written in Python. This version of the generator was intended as a completed work, but it turned out not to be the last stage of this project within my own poetic practice or beyond it.</p>
<p>
	I had started a series of very small poetry generators, ppg256, just over a year before writing this one. While the poetry generators in that series (which is still <a href=""http://nickm.com/poems/ppg256.html"">ongoing</a>) are highly compressed 256-character programs, produce output that sounds avant-garde (or at least not very intelligible), and are written in Perl, &ldquo;Taroko Gorge&rdquo; was written under a different and more relaxed set of constraints. It was created to fit on a single page, with reasonably understandable variable names and explanatory comments. I defined this &ldquo;single page&rdquo; very traditionally, in terms of line printer output: The text was not to exceed 66 80-column lines. &ldquo;Taroko Gorge&rdquo; was meant to generate a boundless poem, as the ppg256 generators did, but this poem was to be a nature poem which would be more traditional and perhaps more identifiable, to some conventional readers, as poetic. And, it was written in Python, a language I prefer for sketching simple literary generators. Most would agree that Python is more easily legible and more easily modified and reworked than is Perl, which is sometimes called a &ldquo;write-only&rdquo; language because of its impenetrability. It&rsquo;s particularly difficult to modify Perl that is intentionally packed into as few characters as is possible. Python, on the other hand, proves fairly easy to consider even for first-time programmers. Indentation makes the scope of, for instance, while loops and if &hellip; else constructs clear even though curly braces are not needed to indicate blocks and even line-ending semicolons are not used in this program.</p>
<p>
	An additional constraint was that I would write the poetry generator in one day and would begin to write it, and draft most of it, at the place it is about, Taroko Gorge National Park in Taiwan. As I wrote and programmed, I did not attempt to parody nature poetry or Eastern poetic traditions. Rather, I sought to show that just as poets have written poems about the natural world as they looked upon it, one could also write a poetry generator about the natural world on the particular site.</p>
<p>
	The comments explain that there are three types of lines generated. The first and last line of any long stanza are &ldquo;path&rdquo; lines meant to suggest the experience of walking along an outdoor path and seeing natural features either above or below. One or more &ldquo;site&rdquo; lines may be generated between these. These lines are less active and are meant to suggest the experience of stopping at a viewing area. Finally, the indented one-line stanzas are &ldquo;cave&rdquo; lines meant to suggest the experience of moving through the tunnels that, like the paths, were carved through the rock by Chiang Kai-shek&#39;s Nationalist army. In many of these tunnels, which are not lit with artificial light, it is not possible to see the exit from the entrance on the other side. This is why the ending of the sentence in a &ldquo;cave&rdquo; line is also unseen. Although I used some one-letter function names, I tried to avoid obfuscation and explained each of the functions at least briefly in the comments at the top.</p>
<p>
	On March 3, I printed ten copies of the program on the dot matrix printer I have in my office. I sent the first copy to my hosts in Taiwan. Alongside the precious signature and date, I numbered each of these material texts in the format &ldquo;2/10 PRINTOUTS&rdquo; to emphasize that unlike these printouts, the program itself is not a multiple, does not exist in an edition, and (even though an explicit license is not attached here) is free for anyone to copy, run, and modify.</p>
<p>
	By March I also had written a JavaScript program that used exactly the same technique as the Python program to produce a boundless poem on the Web. While I do not find JavaScript suitable for clear thought and poetic experimentation, it is very useful for making a finished text-generating program easily available to the world. For this reason, I have written several poetry generators (&ldquo;The Two,&rdquo; &ldquo;Through the Park,&rdquo; and my collaboration with Stephanie Strickland, &ldquo;Sea and Spar Between&rdquo;) first in Python and have followed those versions with a more accessible JavaScript version. The JavaScript version is available here:</p>
<p>
	http://nickm.com/poems/taroko_gorge.html</p>
<p>
	After I put this JavaScript program online, I was rewarded with an amusing surprise. My friend and collaborator Scott Rettberg formulated his own remix of the program, &ldquo;Tokyo Garage,&rdquo; without asking permission &ndash; which, indeed, would have been unnecessary. He posted his program on March 17, explaining in a blog post that he &quot;hacked the words to make it more about urbanity, modernity, and my idea of Tokyo, a city I have never been to.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Over the next two and a half years, others have jumped on the bandwagon and into the gorge. J. R. Carpenter--who had already been using some of my Python programs as a starting point for text generation of her own, to produce texts that appeared in the book <em>Generation[s]--</em>reworked the generator to add images and new strands of text in three new pieces, &ldquo;Gorge,&rdquo; &ldquo;Whisper Wire,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Along the Briny Beach.&rdquo; Talan Memmott brought consumer excess and Comic Sans into the mix with &ldquo;Toy Garbage.&rdquo; Eric Snodgrass snipped up and reassembled Fluxus texts in &ldquo;Yoko Engorged.&rdquo; Mark Sample created a fannish tribute called &ldquo;Takei, Geoge.&rdquo; Flourish Klink followed that up with a generator of incestuous Harry Potter slash fiction, &ldquo;Fred and George.&rdquo; Maria Engberg gazed not at the natural world, but at the campus in her &ldquo;Alone Engaged.&rdquo; And to top all of these off, Andrew Plotkin produced &ldquo;Argot Ogre, OK!&rdquo; which scrolls code and text up the screen, remixing all of the different remixes individually and in pairs. Links to the remixes so far, along with screenshots, can be found here:</p>
<p>
	http://nickm.com/post/2011/09/yo-dawg-i-hear-you-like-taroko-gorge/</p>
<p>
	As I see it, these remixes say nothing about the poetic quality of my original program &ndash; but they speak endlessly about the diverse poetic potential of about a page of code. I would be delighted, of course, to see a hundred more remixes of &ldquo;Taroko Gorge.&rdquo; But even better if it becomes impossible to notice that they are related to my original program. Even better if ten other programs are written that work in completely different ways to generate poems, and each of these are themselves remixed ten times. The idea of developing computational art in a short amount of time, an hour or a day &ndash; an idea that I&rsquo;ve ripped off and remixed from many others &ndash; is what really deserves to get picked up and reworked, again and again.</p>

	I wanted to write a poem about sexual love between partners who discover that their middle-aged bodies are taking on the dilating form of their parents.&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens to eros when a lover looks at the beloved&rsquo;s body and finds the body of the beloved&rsquo;s mother or father in its place?&nbsp; What is the emotional experience, the psychic charge of that recognition?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The first formal impulse was to imitate the stanza of Spenser&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mutabilie Cantos,&rsquo; with its elaborate rhyme scheme and extended final line (pentameter stretching to hexameter). &nbsp;Why?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s difficult to say.&nbsp; Above the obvious interest in Spenser&rsquo;s theme, I simply wanted to try to make my own speech take that shape.&nbsp; I love the tune and formal turning of the verse in Spenser&rsquo;s poetry; it&rsquo;s a more recent attraction for me, having disliked his sophisticated elaborations when, as an undergraduate, I first encountered them in <em>The Fairie Queen</em>.&nbsp; Now I find them enchanting and powerful (such shifts of appreciation &amp; comprehension are one of the delights of getting older, maybe the only one!).&nbsp;&nbsp; I worked for a while on developing a feeling for how that stanza operates, as well as Spenser&rsquo;s ideas about material change, his diction, sentences, and rhetoric.&nbsp; At the same time, I was trying not to fall into Spenserian pastiche. &nbsp;Some of this labor is recorded in Drafts A-1 through A-4; Draft B-1 is the &lsquo;final&rsquo; draft of that compositional process in November 2009. &nbsp;(This is not how I mark my drafts habitually&mdash;I&rsquo;m haphazard at best, keeping in mind Hemingway&rsquo;s sentiment that &lsquo;posterity can take care of itself.&rsquo;)</p>
<p>
	You can see in the A-Drafts how I&rsquo;m sketching out the stanza scheme, which allows for some variation of end-rhyme, and playing with some of those correspondences ahead of the curve, as it were.&nbsp; Playing with rhymes outside of sentence making is like tumbling in a gravity-free chamber.&nbsp; The words connect, but their linking through sound is not determined by the connective tissue of an explicit syntax. &nbsp;One is exploring associations and possibilities that the ear of the rational mind can&rsquo;t hear.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s loads of fun.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the adventure of writing a poem; you set out not knowing where you&rsquo;re going, but having a good gait and an instinct of where to find the trailhead, and when to veer off.</p>
<p>
	Once I got into it, I was excited to find myself writing these stanzas with some facility; it was like discovering you could slalom fast down the mountain after a week in snowshoes.</p>
<p>
	But early in 2010, the poem came to sound like an unmitigated fucking disaster.&nbsp; What had happened?</p>
<p>
	I had fallen into the pastiche I was trying to avoid, for one thing.&nbsp; Also, the metrical contract was leading me into some awkward phrasing; I wasn&rsquo;t in full control of meter, metaphor, and rhetoric, and how they need to fuse into a single element coursing through the poem.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had distracted myself with these &ldquo;crafty&rdquo; problems, and willfully lost my bearing in the more difficult emotional terrain.&nbsp; I had hooded myself in Spenser&rsquo;s idealism, and wasn&rsquo;t able, in the end, to separate the threads of idealism from the</p>
<p>
	word-fabric of his stanza.&nbsp; I had the terrible sinking feeling that I didn&rsquo;t know what the hell I was doing.&nbsp; I was avoiding precisely the problem I had set out to explore.&nbsp; Ignorance is a source of poetry, Wallace Stevens reminds us.&nbsp; These early drafts are not what he was talking about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	I put the poem away for about 18 months.&nbsp; The most difficult thing in writing a poem is to know when you&rsquo;re putting yourself on.&nbsp; I had fooled myself into thinking I was doing the real work, but the fun I had had with craft (poem-making) distracted me from what Seamus Heaney calls <em>technique</em>, which is not synonymous with craft, but rather the poet&rsquo;s stance towards language, experience, and the larger world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Each time I picked up the poem it sounded ridiculous and looked hopeless.&nbsp; Finally, I was able to hold the thing up with some objectivity, neither appraising nor dismissing, and I could hear something I wanted to save, even redeem (the way you redeem an empty bottle for a nickel).&nbsp; I isolated a few sets of lines that still seemed alive and truthful.&nbsp; You can find that highlighting in Draft B-2.&nbsp; I also still liked the poem&rsquo;s gambit.</p>
<p>
	I decided to pull the poem out of the Spenserian stanza; to use a short flexible line with which I had had some satisfaction more recently in other poems; and to explore again the emotional conflict at the center of the poem, to voice some of the darker harmonies. Maybe abandoning the measure of the stanza would help me wise-up to false feelings in the poem. &nbsp;You can see how I was working towards that in Drafts C-1 through C-3.&nbsp; Whereas the A-Drafts show me building the poem stanza by stanza in a more or less linear fashion, the C-Drafts indicate how I broke open the poem at different points to layer in additional images, figures, vocal tones, emotional shades, and turns of argument.</p>
<p>
	For example, one of the keys to unlocking the failed drafts came from a suggestion by another poet, a friend, who pointed me towards Erich Neumann&rsquo;s monumental study of the archetype of &lsquo;the great mother.&rsquo;&nbsp; When I found an image&mdash;I mean, a reproduction of a sculpture&mdash;of the Egyptian goddess Ta-Urt (parts hippo, lion, woman, crocodile, daughter of Ra, who guards the gateway to the afterlife), the terror &amp; dread that I had avoided in the early drafts seemed to have found a symbol, or at least an adequate object.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s difficult to convey, but the image scared &amp; held me at first glance, before I understood what it meant.&nbsp; It took a while to figure out how to plot the appearance of that image, and the poem went through several new drafts before I found the place to break open some lines and lay in the new stuff.&nbsp; I often find myself working in this manner&mdash;refining, enriching, and complicating the poem, so that its form takes on, I hope, increasingly greater and more dynamic definition.&nbsp; This process involves, too, a lot of cutting away.</p>
<p>
	I don&rsquo;t think any of this is unusual.&nbsp; Whether or not the poem&rsquo;s a keeper, it&rsquo;s too soon to say.&nbsp; One thing a good poet and a bad poet may have in common is an interesting process. &nbsp;But the process of writing the poem and the experience of reading it are never the same, even when the experience of reading is directed towards the process of writing itself.&nbsp; &nbsp;And the poet can never mistake the one for the other.&nbsp; The space between the two can shrink, but it never collapses.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s about the extent of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

14862,"contributed_pieces",5671,"Jurassic Park, Animation, and Scientific Visualization",1,1339701558,1343885307,2,5671,14711,"<p>
	&ldquo;<em>Jurassic Park</em>&nbsp;heralded a revolution in movies as profound as the coming of sound in 1927.&rdquo;[1] This quotation is but one of a consensus of pronouncements that have canonized <em>Jurassic Park</em> as a milestone in Hollywood&rsquo;s use of CGI, signaling a new era in film history. The emphasis on the film&rsquo;s revolutionary qualities has obscured the extent to which the film&rsquo;s visualizations of dinosaurs relied on more traditional methods of animation, however. What emerges from a more careful consideration of <em>Jurassic Park</em>&rsquo;s special effects is an appreciation of the intricate mixture of traditional effects&mdash;stop-motion miniatures, large-scale animatronics&mdash;together with advancement in CGI. The general success of the film&rsquo;s effects work can be attributed to its relatively sparing use of CGI and the care with which these effects were combined with time-tested methods.</p>
<p>
	So, for example, one of the film&rsquo;s preproduction stories involves Spielberg&rsquo;s decision to use CGI instead of Phil Tippett&rsquo;s &ldquo;Go motion,&rdquo; a computer-aided refinement of stop-motion techniques. After watching an early CGI scene of the T. Rex chasing a herd of Gallimimus, Stephen Spielberg turned to Tippett and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re out of a job,&rdquo; to which Tippett replied, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mean extinct?&rdquo; This witty bit of banter, a version of which Spielberg inserted into the film&rsquo;s dialogue, exaggerates the impact of the CGI animation, however. Far from being out of a job, the stop-motion team continued to advise the CGI team, since the stop-motion animators&rsquo; craft knowledge of how to animate proved an invaluable aid to the CGI team&rsquo;s development of realistic movement. This teamwork involved the creation of a new technology, the &ldquo;Dinosaur Input Device,&rdquo; an interface that allowed the stop-motion animators to input data for the CGI software using traditional stop-motion manual manipulation, a device that materialized the symbiosis between traditional and emergent special effects techniques (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). The stop-motion/CGI interaction is thus one example of a process of exchange between established and emergent special-effects practices.</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	<img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/oliver_dinosaur_input_device.preview.jpg"" /><br />
	<br />
	<strong>Figure 1:&nbsp;Dinosaur Input Device. A mechanical dinosaur is manipulated by an animator. The stop-motion data is then fed to a software program to create a realistic 3D computer model of the dinosaur.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
	A similar dynamic takes place in the interplay between <em>Jurassic Park</em>&rsquo;s effects and scientific visualization practices. As work by Michelle Pierson, Eric Faden, and others has indicated, digital special effects have manifold and profound links to scientific visualization. When regarded from this perspective <em>Jurassic Park</em> contributes to an understanding of science fiction that emphasizes how the genre continually involves the production of something other than sheer fantasy. The film&rsquo;s raptors were initially based on a falsification, a kind of wishful thinking based on narrative demands, but then a paleontological discovery made the film&rsquo;s vision of the raptors seem more plausible. As Stan Winston joked, &ldquo;We made it, then they discovered it.&rdquo;[2] This fortuitousness, where reality catches up with and/or proves fiction, was not the only way that the film interfaced with knowledge production, however. The effects teams relied on paleontological knowledge of dinosaur anatomy, which was provided largely by science advisors, but the intuitive knowledge of the stop-motion team led to new paleontological knowledge as well. These insights came about as a result of a form of knowledge derived from the animators&rsquo; craft understanding of how dinosaurs &ldquo;should&rdquo; move. This material extrapolation was based in part on exercises where the animators enacted some of the dinosaur movements, using a form of introjective mimicry to guide their work. These craft practices led to a recalibration of paleontological thinking about dinosaur physiology.</p>
<p>
	Overall, then, special effects in <em>Jurassic Park</em> rely on overlapping stop-motion and CGI techniques, as well as deep synergies with scientific visualization processes.</p>

The proliferation of terms they use&mdash;some familiar and colloquial, others specialized or newly coined&mdash;to label and describe their artifacts speaks to the diversity of the collection: <em>process plate</em>, <em>doodle</em>, <em>script template</em>, <em>after-action report</em>, <em>printed circuit board, tactile notebook, </em>and<em>pre-press original comic book page, </em>to name just a few. By drawing HCI into the orbit of the studio arts, the collection allows us to discern points of similarity and difference across different schools of design. Nicholas Chen, for example, likens the process of &ldquo;green-wiring&rdquo;--rewiring traces on the printed circuit board for his electronic reading device--to the act of copy-editing and revising a literary manuscript (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). And transmedia writer and designer Christy Dena&rsquo;s interest in documentation &ldquo;approachability&rdquo; resonates with long-standing principles of user-centered design in HCI. Conversely, Mark Sample&rsquo;s &ldquo;artisanal tweets&rdquo;&mdash;140 character messages inscribed on postcards and delivered via surface mail&mdash;subvert reader expectations about the instantaneity of communication in an age of social media. Sample&rsquo;s project is a reminder that in the arts &amp; humanities, user <em>provocation</em> rather than user satisfaction is often the goal.</p>

<p>
	One way to think about <em>Rough Cuts</em> is as a repository of metaphors about the creative process.&nbsp; For Beth Bonsignore, designing an historical Alternate Reality Game (ARG) is akin to weaving the weft of fiction into the warp of history.&nbsp; For Oliver Gaycken, it&rsquo;s the act of <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=3468"">remediation</a>that&rsquo;s of interest: Gaycken explains how the groundbreaking use of CGI in Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s <em>Jurassic Park</em> relied both conceptually and technologically on the prior art of stop-motion animation. At other times, the dominance of one technology can obscure the affordances of another: Jentery Sayers, for example, discusses his initial struggles to divest himself of print metaphors when &ldquo;writing with sound.&rdquo; This, indeed, is the sticky wicket of metaphor: it can usher in bright new ways of thinking, or it can prolong the rut of the old (along these lines, it has been claimed that Sony Corporation temporarily nixed its plans to develop CD technology in the 1970s because the standard 12&rdquo; diameter of LPs was holding hostage alternative, more commercially viable mental models of smaller laser disks).<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a></p>
<p>
	There&rsquo;s another set of metaphors I want to draw attention to, which revolve around the twin concepts of progress and evolution: we often speak about the &ldquo;origin&rdquo; of an idea or the &ldquo;growth&rdquo; or &ldquo;development&rdquo; of a poem or performance. The tenacity of these developmental metaphors&mdash;the near impossibility of avoiding them--is evidenced by the fact that they appear under various guises throughout this introduction, despite my best efforts to root them out. Although such language might at first seem to capture something fundamental about the creative act, it nonetheless favors a success narrative that belies what can be an intensely discouraging experience.&nbsp; Discussing the role of frustration in creativity, science writer Jonah Lehrer notes in his new book <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Imagine-Creativity-Works-Jonah-Lehrer/dp/0547386079/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1343186878&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=jonah+lehrer"">Imagine</a>&nbsp;</em>how this key ingredient often goes unacknowledged:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">
	When we tell one another stories about creativity, we tend to leave out this phase of the creative process. We neglect to mention those days when we wanted to quit, when we believed that our problems were impossible to solve. Because such failures contradict the romantic version of events&mdash;there is nothing triumphant about a false start&mdash;we forget all about them . . . Instead, we skip straight to the breakthroughs. We tell the happy endings first.<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""">[4]</a></p>
<p>
	In a contribution to <em>Rough Cuts</em> that brilliantly bucks the happy-ending trope, poet Joshua Weiner puts the focus squarely on failure, at one point calling a draft-in-progress an &ldquo;unmitigated fucking disaster.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here success doesn&rsquo;t feel pre-ordained; the life or death of a poem hangs in the balance. What emerges in the course of Weiner&rsquo;s commentary is the ability to let brutal self-knowledge guide a process that involves salvaging a few promising fragments and slowly building them back up. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The artifacts in the collection raise interesting questions about audience: for whom were they originally created, and for what purpose? Many, of course, were intended strictly for personal use. But even among these, there is sometimes a degree of beauty and craftsmanship that seems to presuppose a more public life; an attention to detail that pushes them more toward the cooked than the raw end of the design spectrum, notwithstanding their improvisational qualities. Rita Shewbridge&rsquo;s tactile notebooks, for example, contain the seeds of an idea that eventually resulted in an interactive storytelling dress. The variegated textures of the notebooks and their riot of colors and material, including mud and thread, give them an almost protean quality, as though they&rsquo;re beginning to shape-shift into the textiles they inspire. As Shewbridge asks, &ldquo;Is the art the notebook or is what comes from the book the art?&rdquo; In other cases, middle-state artifacts were expressly created for someone other than the author. Ken Eklund&rsquo;s game engine diagram for <em><a href=""http://www.worldwithoutoil.org/"">World Without Oil</a></em>--the ARG that launched the forecasting game genre in 2007--was made for executives at ITVS, the non-profit organization sponsoring the project. Eklund writes that &ldquo;Game Engine&rdquo; is not a diagram he would have ever created for himself since it expresses information that he had already fully internalized; rather it functioned as a boundary object between Eklund and his funders that aided them in communicating about how the game would work.</p>
<p>
	And what of the ongoing value of the artifacts, once they&rsquo;ve fulfilled their initial purpose? The very existence of a collection like <em>Rough Cuts</em> suggests they may have potential readers, listeners, or viewers beyond those envisioned by their creators. This, indeed, is the <em>raison d&rsquo;etre</em> for historical archives, which are premised on the idea that some records have enduring significance that warrants keeping and preserving them long after their creators are done with them. But as Rick Prelinger&mdash;moving image archivist at the Internet Archive--soberly observes, this assumption is often &ldquo;faith-based&rdquo; rather than evidence-based. &ldquo;Archives often seem like a first-aid kit or a rusty tool,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;resources that we find reassuring but rarely use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	If Prelinger is right, then we ought to ask the same question of <em>Rough Cuts</em> that we would of archives, which is what types of use does the collection conceivably support?&nbsp; Part of the answer lies with teasing out why we are drawn to middle-state artifacts in the first place. A kind of temporal extrusion, they expose process and remind us that our artifactual and built environments are in a continuous state of becoming.&nbsp; At a physiological level, our fascination is consistent with the workings of the human perceptual system, which constantly extracts temporal information from the world around it&mdash;including, paradoxically, from seemingly static objects.<a href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title="""">[5]</a> Laboratory experiments show, for example, that when we view partially illegible handwritten characters, we rely on knowledge about how those characters were most likely drawn to help us decipher them.<a href=""#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"" title="""">[6]</a> And when exposed to similar-looking objects that vary systematically along a continuum&mdash;such as a series of rectangles that become progressively thicker or thinner&mdash;our memory of the final object will be distorted further along the implied axis of change, a phenomenon scientist Jennifer Freyd has aptly dubbed &ldquo;representational momentum.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"" title="""">[7]</a> Our cognitive encounters with objects are thus deeply scored by time: we have an extraordinary capacity for mentally reconstructing their past states and projecting their future ones, and we are primed by thousands of years of evolution to seek out evidence of process and transformation. The ability for middle-state artifacts to exert a gravitational pull on our consciousness should therefore come as little surprise.</p>

	<strong>Figure 2: A progression of rectangles, from thin to thick, after Jennifer Freyd, et al. Lab experiments by Freyd and colleagues predict that individuals will mistakenly recall the last rectangle in the series as thicker than it really is, a form of memory distortion known as &ldquo;representational momentum.&rdquo; The same phenomenon has been reported for other types of transformations in a series, including auditory stimuli involving changes in the pitches of a tone (&ldquo;auditory momentum&rdquo;). &nbsp;</strong></p>

	One of Prelinger&rsquo;s <a href=""http://blackoystercatcher.blogspot.com/2009/06/taking-history-back-from-storytellers.html"">proposals</a>&nbsp;for making archives more relevant and vital is for archivists to model active re-use of the materials in their collections&mdash;by incorporating vintage footage into their own film documentaries, for instance.<a href=""#_ftn8"" name=""_ftnref8"" title="""">[8]</a> Similarly, Nick Montfort puts remixing front and center in his contribution to <em>Rough Cuts</em>, albeit by emphasizing the reader&rsquo;s agency rather than the archivist&rsquo;s: his <a href=""http://nickm.com/poems/taroko_gorge.html"">Taroko Gorge poetry generator</a>&nbsp;has spawned at least <a href=""http://nickm.com/post/2011/09/yo-dawg-i-hear-you-like-taroko-gorge/"">eleven reimaginings</a>&nbsp;since he made a javascript version publicly available. Creating mashups and critical responses, however, by no means exhausts the range of possibilities. As design resources, <em>Rough Cuts</em> and other middle-state collections have the potential to inspire new tools and methods for supporting creativity. What might it be like, for instance, to work within a design environment whose interface was governed by something other than developmental metaphors, to hearken back to the earlier discussion? Or an environment that treated mistakes not as flaws to be papered over, but as design primitives whose imperfections enrich creativity? What if HCI labs routinely incorporated user provocation as well as user satisfaction into their methodologies? No less an authority than Donald Norman has advocated for the importance of both: his <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Design-Love-Everyday-Things/dp/0465051367/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1343498154&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=donald+norman+emotional+design"">classic book</a> on emotional design begins with the story of three teapots that sit atop his kitchen shelf:<a href=""#_ftn9"" name=""_ftnref9"" title="""">[9]</a></p>
<p align=""left"">
	<strong>Figure 3: Norman&rsquo;s teapots, each emphasizing a different design paradigm. From left to right: reflective, visceral, and behavioral design.</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">
	Norman&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;masochistic&rdquo; teapot on the left is rendered perversely unusable by the position of the spout below the handle; the Nanna teapot in the middle combines charm and functionality; and the tilting teapot on the right&mdash;which involves temporarily leaning the pot backward to steep the tea leaves--is an exercise in studied usability.&nbsp; Adopting the terminology of <em>reflective</em>, <em>visceral</em>, and <em>behavioral</em> to refer to the predominant design orientation of each, Norman argues that &ldquo;it is not possible to have a story about design without all three.&rdquo;&nbsp; However disparate the teapots seem, taken together they speak to a coherent design philosophy; they combine an applied perspective (the behavioral dimension) with a more playful or provocative one (the reflective dimension).<a href=""#_ftn10"" name=""_ftnref10"" title="""">[10]</a> The visceral dimension exemplified by the Nanna teapot brings beauty into the equation as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The role of reflective design in this trio is key: it is what helps us discover fault lines in the objects, artifacts, or systems being explored&mdash;the location of a teapot&rsquo;s spout or the mode of a tweet&rsquo;s transmission&mdash;and in doing so allows us <em>to imagine them otherwise</em>: to see them as alterable rather than immutable; as possibility spaces rather than rigid, inherited structures.<a href=""#_ftn11"" name=""_ftnref11"" title="""">[11]</a> It is this dimension of design that allows us to envision ourselves as creative agents of change.</p>
<p>
	The current incarnation of <em>Rough Cuts</em> is itself intended to be intermediate: it is my hope to expand the collection over time. If you have a middle-state artifact you&rsquo;d like to submit, email me at <a href=""mailto:karimkraus@gmail.com"">karimkraus@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m particularly interested in artifacts relating to dance, which is unrepresented in the collection. I&rsquo;d also like to feature one or more artifacts related to design fiction or media archaeological practices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	As someone on the other end of the spectrum from most in this collection, I tend towards research and (textual) scholarship first and creative work second (although this gap is quickly and necessarily closing due to the welcome confluence of design and theory). Consequently, my interest in middle-state forms is rooted in what they can reveal about a given project&mdash;the ideologies, assumptions and strategies that give way to realized meanings. In transmedia practices, where multiple platforms are used to create a coherent, diversely realized fictional world, we might correspondingly expect that for each medium&mdash;be it a film, a print novel or a video game&mdash;there would exist a corresponding document or artifact (a film script, an unedited manuscript, an alpha prototype) that could be used to trace the process of a site&rsquo;s &lsquo;becoming&rsquo; transmedia. This is, at least partially, true. But many transmedia projects don&rsquo;t simply exist as multiple middle-state documents edited into a singular form, but rather as a <em>single </em>document&mdash;what is commonly known as a &lsquo;transmedia production bible&rsquo; or a &lsquo;transmedia story bible&rsquo;&mdash;that is then exploded into multiplicity. Taking their cue from more traditional story bibles found in TV and film, these artifacts are often massive in size, possessing hundreds if not thousands of pages detailing a litany of aspects of a project, from the media being utilized (often ranging from TV shows to video games to graphic novels to film to websites), the audiences targeted, the &lsquo;calls to action&rsquo; (i.e. the ways of engaging the audience with a particular platform) and the planned methods of linking together the sites of the project.</p>
<p>
	Perhaps most importantly, though, transmedia bibles also contain an unusually enormous compendium of story components. Here, we can discover what Jeff Gomez calls the &lsquo;chemistry&rsquo; of the project (Dena 2009: 142), the often meticulously composed lists of fictional locations, events, characters, objects, physics, geographies, politics, and other elements. &nbsp;Story elements that are realized in a platform as a narrative &lsquo;now&rsquo; are coupled with rigorous histories, fantastic mythologies and even potential futures. Interestingly, though, in a process that reflects Derick Johnson&rsquo;s (2009) concept of <em>overdesign</em> (the conscious and purposeful placement of elements in a fictional narrative that are shown but never explained), these potential timelines are not only often never fully explained, but also <em>never seen</em> outside of the bibles themselves. This is, in many ways, the dark archive of transmedia practice, the database that provides a language or code that the fiction draws from and is structured by, allowing for consistently frameworked collaborative design and authorship within the project. (Here, we might also note that more traditional ideas about drafts and pre-publication also figure into play in transmedia practice, as working in multiple platforms produces multiple modes of processural development as well: sketches from a graphic novel, iterative CGI character models, notated code from an early incarnation of a website, etc. Additionally, we might consider the world-building of those like L. Frank Baum or J.R. Tolkien as precursors to the fictional-historical rigor of transmedia bibles, where footnotes and appendices attempt to fill in and also introduce new gaps into the narrative.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	As hinted at above, though, these &lsquo;unseen&rsquo; elements aren&rsquo;t the same as plots that an author might abandon during the process of drafting a novel, shots of a film that wind up as deleted scenes on a DVD, or levels that were never produced in a video game due to budgetary or hardware constraints. Instead, what exists of story in a transmedia bible always exists in potentiality, structured so as to encourage and provide the foundations for future iterations within the fictional universe of the project.&nbsp; Even as a middle-state artifact, then, the transmedia bible exists in perpetuity, not as a transitional state. Hank Kalanz, president of Wild Storm comics, a company specializing in graphic novel extensions of fictional properties, makes a similar observation when talking about the production of the universe of the video game <em>Prototype</em>, which exists with various transmedia engagements:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">
	&hellip;they are creating something from nothing, they are creating a world that is very deep&hellip;but the amount of work they&rsquo;ve put into developing the back story for that game, just&mdash;you know&mdash;<strong><em>volumes and volumes of information about that world prior to when you get to play the game. And all of that is important for the game, except that you&rsquo;re not going to get to see a lot of it&hellip;.</em></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Kalanz 2009; emphasis added)</p>
<p>
	Similarly, Walter Simonson, writer of the popular <em>World of Warcraft </em>comic books, remarks that the amount of information present <em>outside of </em>the elements actualized in existing sites&mdash;information found in books, websites and documents internal to Blizzard&mdash; is &lsquo;an enormous thing to keep track of&rsquo; (Simonson 2009). This is so much the case that the curation of these elements is now a job akin to a historian&rsquo;s in scope. Companies such as Lucasarts, who own the <em>Star Wars </em>franchise, and Blizzard, who produce the popular <em>World of Warcraft</em> games, each employ dedicated personnel whose sole job it is to manage the multiple middle-states of the properties, to ensure that narrative continuity is a direct result of a coherent and consistently realized set of entities. Yet this job is often as much about obscuring the full scope of a particular intellectual property as it is to reveal it. In an <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_36/b4193032898394.htm"">August 2010 interview</a> with Bloomberg Business Week, for instance, Microsoft game developer Frank O&rsquo;Connor reveals that his role with the company is actually closer to a security guard than game maker, watching over the four existing, &gt;10lb. <em>Halo </em>universe story bibles (an excerpt of these, seen above, was published in the <em>Halo Encyclopedia</em> [2009]), each kept under lock-and-key when not in use. Even here, though, such a use is ever only partial: O&rsquo;Connor notes that producers working the <em>Halo </em>universe only ever see the sections of the bible that are relevant to the storylines they are working on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Even so, Simonson notes that a variety of underdefined elements eventually feed into the development of most transmedia fictions, where unpublished artifacts such as characters with a &lsquo;name and a look&rsquo; but no real background or history became fleshed out, major figures in the comics simply because &lsquo;they were there and they were [partially] available&rsquo; (ibid). &lsquo;So we didn&rsquo;t design the characters and give them names&rsquo;, Simonson continues, &lsquo;but we take a certain proprietary air in their very existence&#39; (ibid).</p>
<p>
	While we might play devil&rsquo;s advocate and say that documents like television story bibles also engage in the same sorts of scaffolded creation (Ronald Moore&rsquo;s <em>Battlestar Galactica </em>television series bible, for instance, contains both a developed fictional mythology as well as the articulation of the show&rsquo;s cinema v&eacute;rit&eacute; visual aesthetic), transmedia bibles also represent modes and methodologies of envisioning and mapping media association. What we have in transmedia bibles, then, isn&rsquo;t just multiple levels of middle-state production, but also multiple levels of designing <em>how </em>story might be used as a connective platform in its own right, linking together disparate analog and digital sites as a continuous, coherent whole, thereby creating pathways through colossal fictional universes. In this context, transmedia bibles are more than just documents guiding the continual (re)formation of a certain fiction, but they are also processural <em>theories </em>of media connectivity, blueprints that represent a snapshot of how we view media relations at a certain point and time.</p>
<p>
	Let me make myself clear: this isn&rsquo;t a naive plea for transmedia producer&rsquo;s to &lsquo;open source&rsquo; their production bibles. In many cases, the content of these documents is often treated as proprietary information much the same as, say, the source code to a new Microsoft operating system might be safeguarded. But this is a small call-for-attention to the <em>other </em>side of media convergence. If our habits and relationships with media are becoming more oriented within transmedia ontologies, then it&rsquo;s entirely possible that sites themselves&mdash;those released and consumed by audiences&mdash;will be all we ever have to study. Or, as is the case with the image above from the <em>Halo Encyclopedia</em>, we might more cynically predict that small story trickles from the larger streams of the fictional universe will be rationed and doled out to audiences slowly over time, gaining a sort of narrative (and literal) capital as they do so (indeed, even a mere split-second sighting of an actual <em>Halo </em>bible&mdash;such as when <em>Halo </em>novelist Joseph Staten was seen clutching a binder during an interview&mdash;has increased the artifact&rsquo;s mystique). &nbsp;This isn&rsquo;t to say that transmedia research itself is doomed, but that our access to the practice of process in transmedia projects is already limited to a large degree, removed from the textual articulations of its design*. In other words, we can still enjoy and consume these projects, gaining meanings not possible in any mono-media modes, but we do so all the while knowing that just beneath that paragraph in a novel, just beyond the mountains in a video game&rsquo;s magical world, just a click or two further past the hyperlink of some fictional website, lies a massive unseen, unheard, untouched universe, a universe whose presence alters the gravitational foundations of an increasingly massive slice of contemporary expression. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	*It should be noted, however, that in my experience the vast majority of those working in transmedia production are some of the <em>most </em>open and generous people I know of when it comes to talking about their craft. The trouble with such conversations, though, is how often they contain the same, repeated phrase: &lsquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t really talk about that project specifically&hellip;&rsquo;.</p>

	Many teachers, scholars, and even neurologists argue that such technological distractions are leading us down a path of shallow thinking; that we&rsquo;re sacrificing &ldquo;deep learning&rdquo; for little nuggets of information sprinkled across the web.</p>

This process, Carr contends, prevents us from consolidating and creating connections between old and new information&mdash;in short, it&nbsp;erodes&nbsp;our ability to connect our past experiences, thoughts, and emotions to new situations or ideas we might encounter.</p>

	The conclusion that one immediately draws after accepting this line of reasoning is simple: distractions are a bad thing and so we should strive to avoid them. (In fact, in the spirit of distraction, let me lead you astray by encouraging you to read&nbsp;<a data-mce-href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/health/as-doctors-use-more-devices-potential-for-distraction-grows.html?pagewanted=all"" href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/health/as-doctors-use-more-devices-potential-for-distraction-grows.html?pagewanted=all"" target=""_blank"">this article</a>&nbsp;from the<em>&nbsp;NY Times</em>&nbsp;regarding doctors and distraction.) This claim, while fascinating, is not what I want to get at though.&nbsp;<strong>What I instead want to ask is what I think is a more interesting question:&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;do computers encourage these types of reading and thinking habits?</strong></p>

	I imagine scholar John Slatin would have a few things to say on this matter. In his article &ldquo;Reading Hypertext: Order and Coherence in a New Medium,&rdquo; for instance, he points out that reading in hypertext environments &ldquo;is understood as a discontinuous or non-linear process which, like thinking, is associative in nature, as opposed to the sequential process envisioned by conventional text&rdquo; (874). Although Slatin&rsquo;s claim is surprisingly forward-looking considering the time in which he published the article, I&rsquo;m sure he never imagined a world in which hypertext promised to completely rewire our reading, writing, and thinking patterns.</p>

	As a result of this rewiring, many of us find ourselves dependent on high-powered organizational tools like&nbsp;<a data-mce-href=""http://evernote.com/"" href=""http://evernote.com/"" target=""_blank"">EverNote</a>,&nbsp;<a data-mce-href=""http://www.zotero.org/"" href=""http://www.zotero.org/"" target=""_blank"">Zotero</a>,&nbsp;<a data-mce-href=""http://en.linoit.com/"" href=""http://en.linoit.com/"" target=""_blank"">lino</a>&nbsp;(a personal favorite) and&nbsp;<a data-mce-href=""http://support.google.com/calendar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2465776"" href=""http://support.google.com/calendar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2465776"" target=""_blank"">Google Calendar</a>, among others. &nbsp;It&#39;s because hypertext, as Slatin points out, demands a non-linear thought process that we&#39;re driven to both distraction and reliance on hypertext tools to help us organize and store our thoughts. &nbsp;Ironic, is it not?</p>
