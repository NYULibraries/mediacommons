	The recent publication of Nabokov&rsquo;s final, uncompleted novel, <i>The Original of Laura</i> (Knopf 2008), as a book of facsimile note cards was a timely reminder of the tangled history of the relationship between the book and the note.</p>

<p>
	In its loving reproduction of the authors&rsquo; note cards in codex form, <i>The Original of Laura</i> performed, at a profoundly visual and tactile level, a morphological theory of media &ndash; that notes could become books, indeed that these two very different forms of writing could in fact be synonymous with one another.&nbsp; But in the cards&rsquo; perforation &ndash; one of the most inspired publishing decisions of this our late age of print &ndash; the note cards&rsquo; possible removal from the book also drew attention to the hole in the book&hellip;that was the note.&nbsp; Without notes, so <i>Laura</i> tells us, we have no books.</p>

Michael Kowal (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1973) 58-72.[/fn]; Poe invented the genre of the published &ldquo;Marginalia;&rdquo; Benjamin created his file-folder monument, Das Passagen-Werk; Arno Schmidt began using note-card cases from which would emerge bibliographic monstrosities like his elephantine novel, Zettels Traum [The Dream of Notes] (1970); Hanns Zischler published a recent volume of stories based on hapless found cartographical notations, &ldquo;I Wouldn&rsquo;t Start From Here&rdquo;: Verzettelte Geschichten [Stories from Notes] (2008); or even the new website <a href=""http://www.thingsinbooks.com/"">Things in Books</a> that records all of the scraps of paper (and much more) found in books across the world &ndash; these are all different ways that individuals over the past two centuries have explored the relationship between the technology of the note and that of the codex, to understand how our notes grow into, out of, alongside of, or simply in our books.</p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">	In thinking about this relationship between notes and books, and the various movements between them, I am interested in addressing the larger question of what happens today when our notes and our books increasingly belong to the same medium.&nbsp; Of course we will continue, in Wallace Stevens&rsquo; word, to &ldquo;jot&rdquo;&nbsp;down our ideas on random slips of paper, as Goethe did on theater notices while drafting the last novella of his life.[fn]GSA 25/W2002.[/fn]</p>
<p>
	But I think it is fair to say that for many of us much of our note-taking is done on the same medium as our book writing &ndash; and here is where our current moment strikes me as crucially different &ndash; <i>and our book reading</i>.&nbsp; As we gradually move to a bookish world that is no longer exclusively defined by the printed book (if it ever was), my question is what happens to this lost sense of metamorphosis surrounding composition &ndash; when &ldquo;all is note&rdquo; we might say?</p>

	It consists of a list of sixty points of keywords down the first and third columns, with annotations in the second and fourth, the whole of which has been crossed out with numerous dashes.&nbsp; The numbered keywords (&ldquo;1. Hazy Morning,&rdquo; &ldquo;2. Hunters assembled,&rdquo; &ldquo;3. Departure&rdquo;, etc.) were to provide the framework for the narrative of Goethe&rsquo;s last novella, &ldquo;Novella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Goethe&rsquo;s cancelled list of keywords tells us many things about the nature of note taking in general and its relationship to writing books more specifically.&nbsp; In that columnar structure that would become increasingly common to Goethe&rsquo;s late writing practices we can see just how important the visualization of writing was prior to narration.&nbsp; Synopsis preceded narration, a fact that would become very apparent, for example, in Stendhal&rsquo;s unpublished autobiography, <i>Vie de Henry Brulard</i> (1835/36), in which his self-narrative is intermingled with topographical views of the childhood places he discusses. &nbsp;</p>

	Are these navigational aides for the writer or illustrations for the reader?&nbsp; Either way, the attempt to &ldquo;take it all in&rdquo; in a single image was, for Romantic writers, one of the note&rsquo;s crucial functions as an antecedent to the serial unfolding of bibliographic narrative.&nbsp; As Samuel Coleridge would write in his notebooks, &ldquo;Without drawing I feel myself but half invested in language.&rdquo;[fn]Samuel Taylor Coleridge, The Notebooks of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ed. Kathleen Coburn (London: Routledge, 1957), vol. 1, &sect;1554.[/fn]&nbsp;Nowhere was this idea more iconically on display than in Goethe&rsquo;s double-helix notation that accompanied his life-shaping aper&ccedil;u, &ldquo;Alles ist Blat [All is leaf/sheet].&rdquo;[fn]The spelling of Blat is in the original. &nbsp;See GSA 26/LV,13, Bl. 166v.[/fn]&nbsp;The entanglement of text and image in Goethe&rsquo;s thought was enacted in those doubled, entangled turns of the handwritten note&rsquo;s &ldquo;illustration.&rdquo;</p>

	If the note served Romantic writers with a crucially visual dimension to their writing, it also served the exact opposite function of non-visualization through the practice of cancellation.&nbsp; The note was above all else a space of non-knowledge, a place where we undo ideas (&ldquo;because the mind of the reader,&rdquo; writes Poe in his &ldquo;Marginalia,&rdquo; &ldquo;wishes to unburthen itself of a <i>thought</i>&rdquo;[fn]E.A. Poe, &ldquo;Marginalia,&rdquo; Democratic Review 14 (November 1844): 484, emphasis in original. &nbsp;Or as Poe would later write in the same article, &ldquo;Just as the goodness of your true pun is in the direct ratio of its intolerability, so is nonsense the essential sense of the Marginal Note&rdquo; (485).[/fn]).&nbsp; In Goethe&rsquo;s leaf of numbered keywords there was a tremendous investment in those marks of crossing-out &ndash; why <i>were</i> there so many of them?&nbsp; Nabokov may have achieved the apex of this art of cancellation in a note included in <i>Laura</i>, where we see him working through synonyms of &ldquo;erasure&rdquo; in which one of the words is itself scribbled out. &nbsp;</p>

	I am interested in the difference between the cross-out in Goethe &ndash; where what is underneath is left to view &ndash; and the scribble in Nabokov &ndash; where the idea is fully occluded from view (but not the act of its having once been thought).&nbsp; When we think about taking notes with our computers today, however much hard drives preserve our writing in multiple different states (as Matthew Kirschenbaum has artfully reminded us),[fn]Matthew G. Kirschenbaum, Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2008).[/fn]&nbsp;it seems a far cry from the layering of assertion and cancellation possible with the technologies of pen and paper that comprise the &ldquo;note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	There is one final feature to Goethe&rsquo;s note that I think brings into view this larger dynamic of presence and absence that seems to be one of the key ways of thinking about the note.&nbsp; And that is its legibility.&nbsp; What strikes me as unique about Goethe&rsquo;s late note-taking practices &ndash; which it should be added often occurred through the mediated relationship with a secretary to whom he dictated his ideas &ndash; is the archival identity that his notes began to assume.&nbsp; The crossed-out list of sixty keywords would be replaced on the same day by this beautifully rendered list of 107 keywords in two folio sheets. &nbsp;</p>

	The note produced in &ldquo;Reinschrift&rdquo; or &ldquo;fair copy&rdquo; becomes an end in itself, not a scrap of cancellations that will itself be cancelled by its subsequent appearance in print.&nbsp; There is an important element of surplus to the note here, a remainder that cannot be incorporated into the printed book, a fact beautifully on display (illegible in reproduction) in the way the handwritten columns are bounded by folds in the paper, a practice that became commonplace to Goethe&rsquo;s late note taking.&nbsp; The note, differentiated through its calligraphic formality from the printed page it would become, is also internally differentiated within itself.&nbsp; In passing from note to book something was necessarily left behind, a something that had to remain legible, however, if we were to understand the way writing in books emerged in time.&nbsp; Nothing seemed to argue more forcefully for the morphological relationship between notes and books than this fair copy list of keywords bound by the fold.</p>

	For early-nineteenth-century writers, note-taking would arguably emerge as <i>the</i> idealized form of writing.&nbsp; More than any other scriptural practice, the note seemed to embody the most basic priorities of what we have come to call Romantic knowledge, whether understood as play, negativity, becoming, the momentary or a &ldquo;progressive universal Poesie.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fluidity of the handwritten note, the ephemerality of its surfaces, the liminality of its legibility between script, scribble, and image, its promise to transcend mediality itself all contributed to the note&rsquo;s preeminence as a space of Romantic thought.&nbsp; As Stendhal wrote in a note on the messiness of his handwriting: &ldquo;<span style=""text-decoration: underline ; letter-spacing: 0.0px"">Writing<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">: this is how I write when my thoughts are treading on my heels. If I write well, I waste them.&rdquo;[fn]Vie de Henry Brulard, Les Biblioth&egrave;ques municipales de Grenoble, vol. 2:782.[/fn] The note captured the speed of human thought.</p>
<p>
	When we study the note today we are in many ways thus stepping into and then out of the shadow of Romanticism.[fn]This cluster is, as I see it, thus genealogically related, albeit in a significantly more critical fashion, to the recent turn in literary history towards marginalia studies and before that text-genetic criticism and in the history of science to the turn to &ldquo;the bench&rdquo; and scientific notebooks, trends which seem deeply indebted to this Romantic legacy. &nbsp;For a different understanding of the place of handwritten notes within intersubjective networks of readers during the Romantic period see Michelle Levy, Family Authorship and Romantic Print Culture (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2008) and Andrew Piper, &ldquo;The Art of Sharing: Reading in the Romantic Miscellany,&rdquo; Bookish Histories: Books, Literature, and Commercial Modernity, 1700-1900 (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2009) 126-147.[/fn]&nbsp;Rather than reify the note as a kind of privileged space of a romantically inspired theory of knowledge &ndash; a reenactment of the mediological nostalgia that was also at the heart of an early-nineteenth-century world of increasingly reproducible objects &ndash; I think when we look at the relationship <i>between</i> notes and books we gain a more critical sense of the specificity of the note&rsquo;s meaning, both then and now.&nbsp; Goethe&rsquo;s fair-copy leaf is significant because it shows us, as materially as one can in a scan of a photocopy of a microfilm of a piece of paper, how different digital note-taking is from the pen and paper kind.[fn]I want to emphasize the way the difficulties of reproduction surrounding the critical study of the note is not just an accident of scholarly method but an important component of our understanding of the note as an articulation of difference.&nbsp; The mediations surrounding &ldquo;note studies&rdquo; is part of our knowledge of notes.[/fn] I don&rsquo;t just mean in terms of the corporal differences between clutching a pointed object and moving one&rsquo;s clenched hand over a limited textured surface while one&rsquo;s back is strongly curved, one&rsquo;s head is slightly askew, and one&rsquo;s eyes stare at the point of contact <i>versus</i> sitting upright, staring straight ahead while one&rsquo;s fingers dance up and down in the peripheral field of one&rsquo;s vision on a variegated plastic surface &ndash; although that alone strikes me as significant enough (the crumpledness of note <i>taking</i> versus the uprightness and divisions of note <i>typing</i>).</p>

<p>
	Rather, it is the sheer material difference between penned paper and printed paper that mattered to Goethe, a difference that showed us something about the nature of thought and what it meant to think about nature.&nbsp; Where many of his contemporaries were hard at work incorporating the manuscriptural note&nbsp;<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px; ""><i>into</i><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px; "">&nbsp;the printed page &ndash; making print more note-like as in Poe&rsquo;s printing of his marginalia or Novalis&rsquo; equation of the printed note as a kind of pollination &ndash; for Goethe notes were as much sediments as they were seeds.&nbsp; They showed us the differences that inhered in ideas and forms, the insurmountable remainders of life. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	When we move from notes on computers, whether in Devonthink, remediated post-it notes, or plain old word documents, to books on computers, whether as pdf, ePub, Kindle.app, or iBook, where will this sense of the morphology, the difference of ideas reside?[fn]Benjamin already intuited this potential obsolescence of the book between note-taking systems when he wrote: &ldquo;The card index marks the conquest of three-dimensional writing, and so presents an astonishing counterpoint to the three-dimensionality of script in its original form as rune or knot notation. (And today the book is already, as the present mode of scholarly production demonstrates, an outdated mediation between two different filing systems. &nbsp;For everything that matters is to be found in the card box of the researcher who wrote it, and the scholar studying it assimilates it into his own card index.)&rdquo; &nbsp;Walter Benjamin, Selected Writings, ed. Marcus Bullock and Michael W. Jennings (Cambridge: Belknap, 1996) 1: 456.[/fn] As Nabokov&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>The Original of Laura</i>&nbsp;so visibly showed us, can there be &ldquo;books&rdquo; without &ldquo;notes&rdquo;?&nbsp; Perhaps the point of the printed book today is that, just as in a world of handwritten notes, in a world of digital notes the printed book will continue to argue for the morphological nature of writing &ndash; that writing, like thought, nature, and the self, must be thought of morphologically as change in time in order to capture the larger truth of who we are and the world we inhabit.&nbsp; Without these material articulations of stadial difference we lose a key piece of knowledge of the world.</p>

	Lists as Fandom, Lists as Knowledge: How Grateful Dead Fans Communicate Through Handwritten Tape Lists and Hyperlinked Tape-Trading Communities</p>
<p>
	Recording technology provided an opportunity to preserve live music and transform it into a tangible, exchangeable object. &nbsp;Among Grateful Dead fans in particular, these musical artifacts instigated a community of tapers and tape traders who performed a specific type of fandom through the circulation of recordings. &nbsp;These fans produced and shared tape lists alongside the recordings that qualified and advertised personal collections. &nbsp;Technological development brought changes to the form, thus transforming the list from hand-written notes to hyperlinked networks. &nbsp;With this transformation, the lists became public and interconnected. &nbsp;Meanwhile (re)digitization techniques multiplied the number of circulating recordings and further complicated the exchange process, necessitating a naming standard and a communal list. &nbsp;Through the list, collectors demonstrate knowledge and state opinions, define fandom, and reveal and hide collections. &nbsp;The lists themselves contain the history and the future of this community.</p>
<p>
	Grateful Dead, the band, and Grateful Dead Productions, the company, supported tape trade, at first unofficially through non-regulation, and later officially through the inception of a taper&rsquo;s section at concerts and a statement sanctioning non-commercial trade among fans. &nbsp;The music industry, however, has been known to fight against this type of informal fan circulation of recordings, often chasing it with updates to copyright law. &nbsp;Yet sociologist Lee Marshall argues that tape collectors &ldquo;actually provide ideological support for the recording industry, helping valorize musical commodities&rdquo;; he thus credits unofficial recordings as enhancements to the industry and the dialogue surrounding it.[fn value=&quot;1&quot;]Marshall, Lee, &ldquo;For and against the Record Industry: An Introduction to Bootleg Collectors and Tape Traders,&rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Popular Music&lt;/em&gt; 22, no. 1 [Jan 2003]: 57-72. &nbsp;Please note: &nbsp;Grateful Dead tapers are NOT bootleggers or pirates. &nbsp;Bootleggers&lt;em&gt; sell&lt;/em&gt; live recordings. &nbsp;Pirates sell previously released commercial material. &nbsp;Grateful Dead tape traders collect, share, and trade live recordings of Grateful Dead concerts often produced by the fan themselves.[/fn]&nbsp;Dead Head tape activity, in particular, proved not only to augment official releases, but also to increase the fan base by extending the concert experience beyond the venues and into the everyday lives of fans. &nbsp;In turn, the tape lists extended the discourse by initiating new relationships and offering an additional space to discuss the music. &nbsp;An examination of tape lists, old and new, provides insight into the specialized knowledge of fans and how they communicate that knowledge to one another.</p>

	Listing in Analog</h2>
<p>
	Pictured above is a tape list exemplifying the way fans organize information and communicate to other fans. &nbsp;The left corner of the pictured list identifies it as this fan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Deadlist,&rdquo; indicating the Grateful Dead, organized by year, and printed on August 27, 1993. &nbsp;Specific shows within the list itself are then categorized by location (venue, city, state) and exact date. &nbsp;Other tape lists may include the opening song, a full set list, or musical highlights. &nbsp;These categories exemplify what linguist Natalie Dollar terms &ldquo;show talk,&rdquo; defined as a discourse engaged in by fans when talking at or about a show that demonstrates fan knowledge.[fn value=&quot;2&quot;]Dollar, Natalie, &ldquo;Understanding &lsquo;Show&rsquo; as a Deadhead Speech Situation,&rdquo; in &lt;em&gt;Perspectives on the Grateful Dead: &nbsp;Critical Writings,&lt;/em&gt; ed. Robert G. Weiner [Westport: &nbsp;Greenwood Press, 1999], 89-100.[/fn]&nbsp;&ldquo;Show talk&rdquo; includes referencing shows by venue name, calling the opener, and recounting last night&rsquo;s set list using well-known song nicknames.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">
	Fans who collected tapes extended show talk to include language relevant to the recording technology and tape trade, thus creating a more specific type of fan language I am terming &ldquo;tape talk.&rdquo; &nbsp;The list shown includes two tape talk categories regarding completeness of the tape, &ldquo;set&rdquo; and &ldquo;time.&rdquo; &nbsp;Set noted which parts of the concert are present on the recording. &nbsp;Length quantifies the number of minutes of recorded music. &nbsp;Both figures were particularly important when engaging in equal trade.</p>
<p>
	Tape traders communicated sound quality through &ldquo;source,&rdquo; &ldquo;grade,&rdquo; and &ldquo;gen.&rdquo; &nbsp;Abbreviations denoted sources such as soundboard (BRD or SBD), audience recording (AUD), radio broadcast (FM), and bootleg LP (BLP). &nbsp;Each source has its own benefits, such as clarity from soundboard recordings or ambience found in audience recordings. &nbsp;Grade, a subjective and personal category, labeled the tape according to individual taste and collector knowledge. &nbsp;&ldquo;Gen&rdquo; indicated the generation of the tape, or the distance from the master recording, an essential distinction in analog trade because sound quality noticeably decreased with subsequent copies. &nbsp;&ldquo;Notes&rdquo; provided a space for the collector to elaborate on any item, to engage in show talk and tape talk with potential trading partners. &nbsp;Finally, the &ldquo;from whom&rdquo; column kept a record of personal trades and the circulation of specific tapes. &nbsp;[This type of list served as a quick reference; for examples of more extensive analog notes see <a href=""http://dicklatvala.com/notebooks.htm""><span class=""Internet_20_link""><span class=""T2"">http://dicklatvala.com/notebooks.htm</span></span></a>.]</p>
<h2>
	The Path to Digital</h2>
<p>
	In the year 2000, a group of collectors embarked on a project to digitize and share their collective set of recordings. &nbsp;It started when one collector, known as Raoul Duke, donated his personal CD collection to the group in order to load the CDs onto hard drives, organized by year of recording. &nbsp;These hard drives were to be vined through the group (an old form of distribution whereby one member copied the drive and then mailed it another member and so forth) and sent to Sweden where they would be made accessible to everyone through an FTP server known as TOL. &nbsp;With this project, referred to as &ldquo;The Music Never Stopped Project&rdquo; (TMNSP), the exchange group successfully outlined and implemented standards widely utilized today among all live music collectors.</p>
<p>
	To efficiently use hard drive space and speed up Internet exchange, these collectors needed to compress the music files. &nbsp;At the time consumers of the music industry had begun to turn to MP3 technology. &nbsp;Instead, Dead Heads strictly enforced lossless compression formats such as shorten (shn) and free lossless audio codec (flac) to ensure high quality.</p>
<p>
	When downloading from TOL, traders wanted to browse the hard drives at a glance without taking the time to tediously open the text files and identify specific recordings. &nbsp;So, Matt Vernon, a member of TMNSP, designed a naming standard that would identify the recording in the file name itself. &nbsp;The format includes: two letter band abbreviation, date, information regarding the recording process, the last five digits of the SHN id, sound boundary error reference, and file format. &nbsp;An example file name result would be:</p>
<p class=""center"">
	gd73-07-01.fob-SonyECM22p.kaslow-todd-motb.88528.sbeok.flac16</p>
<p>
	In this example, &ldquo;gd&rdquo; represents the Grateful Dead. &nbsp;The recording was made on July 1, 1973 in front of the soundboard (fob=front of board) using a Sony ECM22P recorder. &nbsp;Harv Kaslow and Craig Todd taped it, and an editing group named Mouth of the Beast (MOTB) digitized, edited, and seeded it. &nbsp;The recording is a FLAC file seeded in 16-bit format.</p>
<p>
	The SHN id serves to identify this recording transferred through a particular set of technologies and edited by a particular people. &nbsp;If the same master tape were to be redigitized and re-seeded, it would receive a new SHN id, given by the SHN id authority, etree.org. &nbsp;The naming standard, and especially the SHN id, became a necessity to identify specific files and prevent duplication as more and more individuals seeded their own personal collections onto the Internet. &nbsp;Therefore, current hard drive lists look like this:</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Sbeok,&rdquo; or, more rarely, &ldquo;SBEfail,&rdquo; refers back to a conflict within the community of traders regarding digital audio and tracking. &nbsp;One method of tracking actually created digital noise. &nbsp;So, when a small group within TMNSP, known as Jerry&rsquo;s Kids, labored to transfer Raoul Duke&rsquo;s CDs, they checked for &ldquo;sound boundary error&rdquo; and labeled the files accordingly.</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/tne/files/images/harvey_katie_figure2.preview.png"" style=""width: 400px; height: 263px; "" /></p>
<p>
	The Music Never Stopped Project and Jerry&rsquo;s Kids defined a standard. &nbsp;Their work laid the foundation for not only the Grateful Dead community but also the larger network of non-commercial circulation of live recordings. &nbsp;Their system is still in use.</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, TOL was eventually shut down. &nbsp;Thankfully, Matt Vernon had already found a more permanent home for the newly-digitized public collection at Archive.org&rsquo;s Live Music Archive (LMA), where the collection is still available today through downloading and streaming. &nbsp;Fans, no matter their age or level of experience, can access LMA and hear the sounds of the Grateful Dead while reading statistics and composing personal reviews.</p>

	In addition to the Archive.org collection, individual collectors and exchange groups circulate their music through a variety of other FTP servers and bit torrent sites such as etree.org, Lossless legs, Workingman&rsquo;s Dead, and dime-a-dozen. &nbsp;These online social networks and communal archives also serve as repositories for conversation, for modern day tape talk. &nbsp;Fans swap stories and annotate archival information. They recommend recordings and trump each other&rsquo;s opinions. &nbsp;They critique, correct, and relive the experience.</p>
<p>
	Importantly, this banter can, at times, bring light to the true source of a recording as the listeners discuss the nature of the content and the quality. &nbsp;As an example, LMA holds five different recordings for the Grateful Dead concert on September 18,1970. &nbsp;One file displays a very short song list, a small portion of the music played on that night. &nbsp;There are three reviews attached to it (pictured below).</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/tne/files/images/harvey_katie_figure3.preview.png"" style=""width: 400px; height: 261px; "" /></p>
<p>
	The first comment (the most recent) annotates the online document with experiential knowledge of the show itself: &nbsp;the weather, (torrential rain), noteworthy audience members, (Tim Leary and Mayor Lindsey), special guests (Dustin Hoffman and Harry Kellerman), cultural history (Jimi Hendrix&rsquo;s death), personal history (friend waited outside), and a testimony (life altering experience).</p>
<p>
	The two previous reviews serve to correct information connecting this recording to the actual event. &nbsp;One reviewer points out that Dark Star was not played that night and suggests that other listeners and fans check their own notes on this performance. The other reviewer, having already listened to other recordings of this concert, recognized that this version of Sugar Magnolia was not the actual version from the show. &nbsp;To solve the mystery, a curator from LMA added his own notes (pictured below). &nbsp;</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	<img alt="""" src=""/tne/files/images/harvey_katie_figure4.preview.png"" style=""width: 400px; height: 311px; "" /></p>
<p>
	As you can see, the curator clarified the source of the file song by song while claiming that he himself built this configuration and circulated it among friends beginning in 1997. &nbsp;These types of compilation recordings surface in public archives. &nbsp;Due to SHN ids, and the malleable, publicly accessible archive, items such as this can be (re)documented accurately and circulated accordingly.</p>
<p>
	The avenues through which tape collectors find and interact with one another have changes drastically. &nbsp;Building analog trading networks required patience. &nbsp;Tape traders copied tapes in real-time and waited days, weeks, or months to receive copies of other tapes via snail mail. &nbsp;They searched for specific recordings through monthly fanzines and early online bulletins. As technology shifted, from analog to digital and from paper to electronic, Dead Heads constructed new forms of trade and faster avenues of communication.<span class=""T3""> &nbsp;</span>These mediated tools allow fans instant and widespread communication. &nbsp; Listening to a show and immediately discussing it with an extensive social network of other collectors and fans has become commonplace. &nbsp;Recording technology brought the music away from venues and live concerts; now, fifteen years after the band has stopped performing live, these fans still listen to and comment on the music of the Grateful Dead as part of their daily lives.</p>
<p>
	Beginning in the 1980s, the first academic wave of fandom studies worked within the dichotomous structure of fans vs. fan object, where fans, though seen as &ldquo;beautiful,&rdquo; remained disempowered &ldquo;others.&rdquo; &nbsp;Drawing from Pierre Bourdieu, the second wave identified fan cultures as a reflection of societal structures and habitus. &nbsp;More recently, in the introduction to <span class=""T1"">Fandom: &nbsp;Identities and Communities in a Mediated World,</span> Johnathan Gray, Cornel Sandvoss, and C. Lee Harrington<span class=""T1""> </span>highlight that &ldquo;changing communication technologies and mediated texts contribute to and reflect the increasing entrenchment of fan consumption in the structures of our everyday life.&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;3&quot;]Grey, Johnathan, Cornel Sandvoss, and C. Lee Harrington, eds., &lt;em&gt;Fandom: &nbsp;Identities and Communities in a Mediated World&lt;/em&gt; [New York: &nbsp;New York University Press, 2007], 3.[/fn]&nbsp;Instead of waiting for the tour, the new fanzine, or the letter, Dead Heads are now able to connect with one another in real time, to gather, share, and celebrate the music and those who labored to preserve it.</p>
<p>
	In today&rsquo;s musical environment, in the long-wake of Napster, iTunes, and copyright law reform, the decision of this band to support this activity of their fans should be hailed as an alternative model to the power dynamic designed and implemented by large record companies and their control over the flow and access of recorded sound. &nbsp;With the Grateful Dead, the fans produced the written and digital archive of the band (<span class=""T1"">before</span> the band had a chance to do so). &nbsp;And they built it upon a foundation that they themselves constructed through analog trade. &nbsp;Today, the fan base itself continues to grow as new fans, regardless of age or experience, discover the Grateful Dead and find at their fingertips hours and hours of recorded sound, along with set lists, guided commentary, and technological knowledge communicated and documented by Dead Heads themselves. &nbsp;Fan activity exists as a living archive, a living culture in which the lists and hyperlinked communities not only demonstrate the values and opinions of the community, but become cultural documents in and of themselves.</p>

	Paul Pridgeon in Arlington, Massachusetts sent in to the Found website a to-do list that he picked up off the street, giving it the title &ldquo;There Are Options.&rdquo; What once served as a lonely individual&rsquo;s list of possibilities for passing the time (&ldquo;Go for a walk with someone, go out with someone&hellip;Go to the cemetery and talk with my mom&hellip;Go in my room&rdquo;) is repurposed and given new meaning as a poignant slice of someone&rsquo;s inner life. The forum discussion for this post is exemplary with regard to the compassion that can be expressed among those with a shared experience. Strangers, pseudonymously, virtually, extend themselves to one another emotionally.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	<font face=""Times"">With the end-of-the-century therapeutic culture transforming into a culture of confession, online anonymity allows individuals to voice needs, concerns, fears, and ideas detached from one&rsquo;s own identity. Much online public interaction involves participation in virtual communities: cyber-groups based upon people connecting with others who share similar values, interests and concerns in order to exchange information, gain companionship and provide emotional support (Wellman and Gulia 1999). However, artifacts exhibited on Found&rsquo;s website can serve as conduits for relationships between audience and others, rendered through the nearly visceral representation of digital objects, without access to the creator&rsquo;s intention or the categorization of a particular theme</font>.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	Found began when site creator Davy Rothbart discovered a note, intended for someone else, on the windshield of his car. The note, described on the website (<font color=""#0000ff""><u><a href=""http://foundmagazine.com/"">http://foundmagazine.com</a></u></font>), as containing an &ldquo;amazing mixture of anger and hopefulness,&rdquo; was passed among Rothbart&rsquo;s friends. Interest in this found object led to the creation of a magazine that could serve as a forum for sharing similar &ldquo;finds.&rdquo; Each day, a new found object is posted on the site, typically a note or photograph that is lost or discarded. Found encourages visitors to submit &ldquo;love letters, birthday cards, kids&rsquo; homework, to-do lists, ticket stubs, poetry on napkins, telephone bills, doodles&mdash;anything that gives a glimpse into someone else&rsquo;s life.&rdquo; Found items are sometimes poignant, sometimes funny, always giving a sideways glance into someone&rsquo;s interior world.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	The value of the seemingly intimate, hand-made, misplaced, or discarded item increases exponentially as it is shared through Found&rsquo;s digital platform. Because the visitor to Found has no existing personal connection to these artifacts, meaning and connection is produced in the exchange between the viewer and the digitally present image. As John Berger points out, &ldquo;We never look at just one thing, we are always looking at the relation between things and ourselves&rdquo; (9). When what we are looking at are the expressions of other people&rsquo;s inner lives, we also are participating in the relation between ourselves and others. The digitally present object&mdash;list, photograph, or note between friends&mdash;serves as a conduit for that relationship. Berger&rsquo;s point, however, is that looking inevitably involves bringing oneself to the encounter. Visitors to the site construct narratives around these objects, and the speculative creation of these narratives can be one of the pleasures of Found. In whatever imagined context the audience creates, these artifacts offer a glimpse into the personal and human circumstances of everyday life. Something about the self is revealed or learned, and looking outward is a way of looking inside.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	Lists are a kind of collage, comprised of the little bits of wants and needs that make up a sense of who we are through the things we buy or need to do. The lists on Found&mdash;what warrants their inclusion as finds&mdash;are usually quirky and often show the listmaker struggling with something. Lists help us manage our time, our circumstances, and the emotional weight of our lives. By titling his find &ldquo;Back to the Old Ways,&rdquo; Jonathan Shipley posits the list writer may be trying to change her ways; the list includes Diet Coke, water, tonic, tampons, vitamins and &ldquo;frozen healthy shit,&rdquo; perhaps the beginning of a new diet. The last item on the list, &ldquo;Wine?&rdquo; shows the possibility of a lingering thread of desire for what Shipley calls &ldquo;the old ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	<img alt="""" src=""http://www.foundmagazine.com/images/finds/full/backtotheoldways.gif"" style=""width: 300px; height: 211px; "" /></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	This brief, anonymous list opens an opportunity for women to &ldquo;talk among themselves&rdquo; about the social pressures for thinness. Through Found&rsquo;s online commuity the audience has access to different kinds of lists&mdash;those that are made as goals, with contemplation, and those that are made as reminders, easily checked off. Lists are statements of intention, and both the lists of long term goals and quick everyday reminders reflect the gesture of &ldquo;putting it in writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	Many comments in this forum argue that the listmaker&#39;s perspective may be more of an everyday way of being rather than an isolated event, as women struggle to balance their desires with a sense of what they feel they should do. One poster writes, &ldquo;Yeah, if you add &lsquo;chocolate&rsquo; then this is pretty much what I live on,&rdquo; while others add that the list reminds them of a cousin, a sister, or a roommate. &ldquo;Vanessa in California&rdquo; offers empathy and advice for the anonymous, and absent, listmaker:</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	&ldquo;she&rsquo;s pms-ing, bloated, stressed out, and she needs to get cute for a date tomorrow night. load up on those diet pills my dear. just maybe skip the diet coke, that is a lot of caffeine...&rdquo; Vanessa&rsquo;s direct address shows the evocative power of lists&mdash;even those as mundane as shopping lists&mdash;to create a sense of the listmaker&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	Posting on discussion boards and participating in online forums is an everyday activity, yet there is always a reason behind one&rsquo;s desire to post. In the case of Found, motivation may come from the artifact itself, when a reader wants to offer an interpretation or comment on the object. Others may be inspired to post in a forum because of their compassion for the person who created or owned the found artifact, often as an expression of similar feelings or experiences.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	Some of the lists posted on Found lead to lengthy discussions that are at times wry, tender, cantankerous, and droll. The list that begins &ldquo;dump Adam,&rdquo; found between the pages of a used book, has a casual, offhand feel despite the gravity of its contents. After &ldquo;dump Adam,&rdquo; the listmaker includes &ldquo;grad mufukin school,&rdquo; &ldquo;run &frac12; marathon,&rdquo; &ldquo;run 5 5K&rsquo;s,&rdquo; &ldquo;learn spanish, guitar, typing,&rdquo; &ldquo;waterfall,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Europe.&rdquo; The contrast between the informal list and the enormity of the tasks leads to a witty exchange on the forum. One poster writes, &ldquo;poor Adam. dumping him even made the top of the list. I hope he deserves it, and it&rsquo;s not just part of her plan for &lsquo;an all new better life&rsquo; i.e; &lsquo;lose weight, finish school, then trade up to a new better spouse.&rsquo;&rdquo; Another adds, &ldquo;Dont go to mufukin grad school or you wont get any of those other things done!&rdquo; Running alongside the humorous perspective of these forum posts is a sense of curiosity, as the temporary knowledge community works together to decipher the anonymous listmaker&rsquo;s desires. A forum poster named Sarah notes that the list reminds her of herself, and that she had accomplished many similar things over the preceding year. She then turns her self-expression back to the purposes of the group: &ldquo;But unfortunately for decoding purposes the two biggest mysteries&mdash;undumpable Adam and the unfathomable Waterfall&mdash;were not on my list.&rdquo;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	The online commentary surrounding textual and visual postings can mirror a viewer&rsquo;s critique of a work of art or literature. In that, despite the author or poster&rsquo;s original intentions, perspectives of the objects evolve with the conversations surrounding it, through both negative and positive forum feedback. The frequent pathologization of listmakers is enacted by the audience&rsquo;s deliberation over the object through both sentimental and sometimes harsh critique.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">
	Christopher Luna&rsquo;s find, which he titles &ldquo;Hide From Yourself,&rdquo; is a peculiar list which includes &ldquo;Beat up a pillow,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hide from yourself,&rdquo; &ldquo;brush hair wrong way&rdquo; and &ldquo;pretend you&rsquo;re on a talk show.&rdquo; From these unusual imaginings, the idea of a singular self takes form. Cait in New Hampshire confesses that she can relate to the author: &ldquo;When I was in around 4th grade I would imagine that all the time. Talk to myself, as if I was on Oprah.&rdquo; What might feel charming and eccentric at first glance is transformed in the forum as posters cast the author as someone potentially suffering. &ldquo;danielle in flagstaff, az&rdquo; notes, &ldquo;this is a list of things to do instead of eating&hellip;the things on the list are on lots of pro-ana sites. just a little fyi.&rdquo; Apparently displeased with danielle&rsquo;s tone, &ldquo;your mom in the laundry room&rdquo; responds, &ldquo;just a little fyi for danielle in flagstaff, this list sounds to me like things autistic people do.&rdquo; <font face=""Times"">The foundation of anonymity increases the pleasure of viewing, and allows audiences freedom to express opinions about the objects.</font></p>

	The Found phenomenon has originated from and continues to thrive due to our human need for community and to be understood by identifying with common expression, organization, ideas, and emotions of anonymous others. The everyday nature of lists can reveal something more substantial and significant about their authors. Since the authors of Found lists are absent, their lists often lead readers to turn contemplation back on themselves, allowing us to learn a little bit about ourselves, every day.</p>

Note-taking as part of creative development is often an extensive and evolutionary process, often undertaken with the purpose of culminating into a final product &ndash; an essay, a thesis, a script, an article. The prevalence of social networking, whether through Facebook or through online journals such as The New Everyday means that collaborative, online note-taking is now a common practice that allows others to add to our ideas, sometimes resulting in our own notes and theories evolving in different directions.&nbsp;</span></span></font></p>

The pathway feature is unique to the SP-ARK website; it merges the concept of blogging and forum posting, and also allows the user to combine his or her notes and ideas with material from the website itself &ndash; effectively creating a stream of ideas with Potter&rsquo;s original notes embedded within them. <b>[insert WILKINS1.JPG &ndash; also available here:</b> <a href=""http://www.sp-ark.org/pathways.php""><span style=""text-decoration: underline ; letter-spacing: 0.0px color: #3508fd"">http://www.sp-ark.org/pathways.php</span></a><b>] </b>The concept behind this note-taking facility is to create and build links between the archive and the user resulting in a &ldquo;living archive&rdquo;, an ongoing interaction with Potter&rsquo;s work, making the website more than just a reference tool and encouraging intellectual exchange through online note-taking. Furthermore, the pathway tool facilitates social networking by providing users with the opportunity to comment on other users&rsquo; pathways, or to send private messages, providing the option of one to one dialogue as well as open discussion between visitors to the website.

As you accumulate your ideas, incorporating assets from the archive is a simple matter of selecting an item and clicking the &ldquo;add to my pathway&rdquo; button, resulting in a mini version of the asset appearing in your own pathway with an &ldquo;add comment&rdquo; button underneath &ndash; inviting the user to continue on his or her note-taking journey.&nbsp;<b> [insert Wilkins2.jpg &ndash; also available here: </b><a href=""http://www.sp-ark.org/SPA0000447/""><span style=""text-decoration: underline ; letter-spacing: 0.0px color: #3508fd"">http://www.sp-ark.org/SPA0000447/</span></a><b>]&nbsp; </b>Having the artefacts in front of you allows your thoughts to be noted down immediately, and the fact that your notes can be saved means that you can return to your ideas and allow them to evolve as part of your pathway. Through the incorporation of this note-taking tool on the website, there is the sense that the user &ndash; through note-taking &ndash; increases the significance of the already valuable items featured on SP-ARK by adding their personal notes and ideas. Furthermore, when adding an asset to a pathway, the names of users who have previously incorporated this asset into their own pathways are shown &ndash; allowing access to the note-taking of others and further facilitating the social networking aspect of the website by encouraging the user to observe the ideas of others and potentially engage with them.&nbsp;</span></span></font></p>

The Internet context enhances note-taking practice with unprecedented usability: studying film by creating online notes in a pathway &ldquo;notebook&rdquo; was applauded by students at Queen Mary, University of London, who have utilised SP-ARK and its pathway feature as part of an undergraduate course on adaptation. This project involved the students exploring the archive assets and creating their own pathways about Potter&rsquo;s adaptation of Woolf&rsquo;s novel. The students commented that the pathway tool was innovative, simple to use, and most of all, an effective note-taking tool due to its linear structure. The students explained that this type of structure is most effective for essay planning since it allows for a step-by-step accumulation of notes which then become a detailed plan, and in this particular task, formed the basis of their assessed essays.&nbsp;</span></span></font></p>

Using the website as part of his teaching, Dr Charles Drazin (Queen Mary) found that the pathways &ldquo;facilitated the provision of on-going feedback as students worked on their assignment in a way that is not feasible in traditional coursework.&rdquo; He added that the pathway feature of SP-ARK &ldquo;is at the core of what is valuable and innovative about the site&rdquo; precisely for its note-taking opportunities by allowing his students to build their ideas around the assets in the archive and create a living and ongoing discussion about them.</span></span></font></p>

Vicki Callahan of UW-Milwaukee and USC refers to the pathways as allowing the user to leave a &ldquo;research trail&rdquo; that simultaneously immerses the user in the archive artefacts, yet also &ndash; through note-taking and collaborative note-taking &ndash; creates new historical artefacts since the commentary and discussion about each archive asset remains a permanent feature of the site.</span></span></font></p>

The pathways feature provides clear opportunities for social networking, and in this context, a significant form of modern note-taking that can actively contribute something valuable to discussion between film scholars. Yet much feedback requested further features, such as the option to make notes confidential if being used for formal assessment or private research, the ability to view multiple pathways, the option to export notes from pathways into a Word document and the opportunity to create group pathways.&nbsp;</span></span></font></p>

However, as is often the case with online communities and social networking, the issue of regulation is one that emerges. The moderation of user input is a challenge for any website that encourages user involvement and one which poses questions about overreliance and trust. However, I would assert that discussion and interaction is one of the underlying features of academia and these types of online teaching and learning platforms add another way in which students can engage with peers, teachers, academics and other users who share common interests. The danger of placing too much trust in interchanges with unfamiliar users is equivalent to the care and common sense we must all take when communicating with those we do not know personally. Within the concept of note-taking, I would assert that when used sensibly, online tools that create new opportunities for the accumulation of notes and ideas, should be embraced, yet acknowledged as just one of many ways that creative note-takers gather their ideas.</span></span></font></p>

	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">History is made when archives accession and &ldquo;process&rdquo;&mdash;as it is called&mdash;records of interest. One of the first steps in processing any collection is the removal of items hazardous to the records themselves. For the most part this means that the original boxes and folders are replaced with new, acid-free ones, but I can remember at least one case in which strips of nitrate film (combustible) needed to be removed, and another in which a sample of mineral hornblende or pitchblende (radioactive) had to be whisked away. These things happen. By far the most common hazard excised from within boxes and folders, though, is the paperclip. Like water, mold, insects, and war, paperclips are the enemies of archival preservation. Like water, mold, and insects, paperclips have no history. (Wars, as we know, have histories according in part to the archives that survive them.) A potential agent of rust, the paperclip is forever banished from the historical record wherever professional archivists hold sway. A paperclip is neither document nor document-able but slips unwanted into a barely discernable crack between the archive and museum. There is a bricks-and-mortar museum someplace in Britain devoted to the history of the pencil and one in Baltimore devoted to the history of the tampon, or so I&rsquo;ve been told, but no museum that I know of renders a history of the paperclip. There is no such thing.&nbsp;</span></p>

	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">As processing archivists well know, before a scourge of bent metal fasteners flooded the records of business and civil service in the later nineteenth century, potential agents of rust were already lurking. Straight pins, large and small, were sometimes used to connect sheets, which might alternatively be bundled with colored string (familiarly, &ldquo;red tape&rdquo;) and pigeonholed or otherwise sorted and arranged according to the reigning logics of bureaucratic labor. Pins damaged the historic fabric, one might say, pricking holes where paperclips would later press together without puncture. Offices using straight pins tacked pages as they tailored paperwork. These were incremental workaday acts that pointed doubly toward the phylogenies of paper&mdash;originally made of rags&mdash;and of files. The OED tells us that a file was once &ldquo;a string or wire, on which papers and documents [were] strung for preservation and reference.&rdquo; Pretty soon a file came to refer both to the string or wire and to the collection of pages so strung: certainly neither the first nor the last time that object and subject have emerged to semantic conflation. The word indenture offers a related case, since it referred first to a medieval legal agreement with its separate pages indented along one edge so that they fit together. Connecting became containing, as the things done to pages (materially) became the things done on them (linguistically) and then with them (instrumentally).</span></p>

	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px"">If straight pins, staples, and ring binders help to recall the original meaning of file by transecting the pages they collect, then they also help to evoke &ldquo;the managerial revolution&rdquo; of the late nineteenth century, whereby the modern corporation emerged to reshape the world economy it has since defined. Structural changes to labor and finance accompanied changes to the techniques of management. Modern offices hatched new genres, like the memo, and entailed new gender politics, welcoming women secretaries at the same time that they welcomed a raft of new business machines, everything from telephones and typewriters to the humble staple and paperclip. Vertical filing alone&mdash;file folders arranged in file cabinets&mdash;is said to have worked a revolution in bureaucracy, circa 1890. While students of big business know that corporate power tends to be consolidated according to the directional logics of vertical and horizontal integration, the years that I have spent trolling through archives have prompted an appreciation of additional micro-logics: Corporations may proceed by integration, but offices function according to enclosure and attachment. Folders and envelopes are differently instruments of enclosure, while paperclips and staples attach. These are micro-logics by which bureaucratic labor collects and connects; in short, these are the everyday techniques whereby bureaucracies know.</span></p>

The paperclip icon signifies attachment in the email program I usually use, though of course the act of sending an email attachment is far different than clipping sheets of paper together. One difference is temporal. Paper attachments can be composed after the documents to which they adhere&mdash;think of annotated coversheets&mdash;while paper enclosures necessarily antedate the missives that enclose them. Email attachments have reversed this clock. They work more like traditional enclosures, since you can&rsquo;t attach an electronic file to your email message unless the file already exists. But the biggest distinction to be drawn between old forms of attachment and new is probably that sheets clipped together can be pages of the same document or they can be different documents, but an email attachment is always a distinct entity. Bent steel paperclips harbor a sort of attachment theory in miniature, we might say, whereby a document negotiates its own identity as/and others. (The ugly &ldquo;as/and&rdquo; is key.) By contrast, an email attachment is always alien to the email that makes it one. Papers get clipped for storage and transmission, but email attachments exist only to be transmitted and unattached, unmade, undone. This may be what accounts for the beauty of these old paperclips, as I see them. Each was one of millions, here rendered one-of-a-kind. And each in its ingenious, intricate morphology hints a model of attachment on distinctive terms.</span></p>

	Quotidian inscriptions &ndash; annotating, jotting notes, making lists &ndash; are some of those &ldquo;things we do everyday&rdquo; that, despite their everydayness, are constantly being <i>de</i>naturalized, reimagined, and redesigned for different writing substrates and media platforms (from clay tablets to quipu to Blackberries to the back of your hand) and different populations and settings and applications (from professional conferences to the grocery store). Digital reading devices and applications, despite their frequent attempts to approximate the look of the printed page, often frustrate readers&rsquo; desire to <a href=""http://craigmod.com/journal/ebooks/?success""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><i>mark up</i></span></a> <a href=""http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Initial-Thoughts-about-the/23091/""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">the page</span></a> as they would a printed book; highlighting, annotating, and underlining work differently &ndash; or not at all &ndash; across these platforms. Software developers have created a dizzying array of applications for taking and organizing notes. Choosing amongst these options requires that we reflect on how we organize our thoughts, and how we want the software to help us become the more efficient, better organized, more productive note-takers we <i>want </i>to be.&nbsp;</p>

	What platforms will allow us to become our idealized note-taking selves? Apple&rsquo;s own <a href=""http://www.apple.com/ipad/features/notes.html""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Notes</span></a> app offers a digital legal pad for text-based notes and lists of all kinds; I use mine to store user names, shopping lists, and geographically-organized lists of all the exhibitions I want to see around the city. <a href=""http://www.evernote.com/""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Evernote</span></a> encourages an expansive definition of &ldquo;the note&rdquo;; everything from text and voice memos and meeting notes to photos, videos, screenshots, and pdfs can be organized into your notes file and separated into different &ldquo;notebooks,&rdquo; then made searchable across <a href=""http://blog.evernote.com/2010/04/03/evernote-for-ipad-is-here/""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">various devices</span></a>. (This raises the question: What does it mean when, as contributor Andrew Piper puts it, &ldquo;all is note&rdquo;?) <a href=""http://popplet.com/""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Popplet</span></a> is a new application for individually or collaboratively &ldquo;curating,&rdquo; or spatializing the relationships between, notes. Rather than the notebook or file box metaphor, Popplet offers a virtual whiteboard on which you can organize your notes into a concept map.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> There are plenty more applications where these came from. Yet even these few examples raise the question of what constitutes a &ldquo;note&rdquo; on each of these platforms. How do their interfaces and underlying code inform the way users conceive of, create, organize, and navigate between notes, lists, memos, etc.?&nbsp;</span></p>

	Examining the way individuals or groups of people take notes, historian Ann Blair suggests, can &ldquo;shed light on cultural expectations and material practices that are representative of a particular historical context&rdquo; and can reveal how &ldquo;methods of note taking&hellip;contribute to shaping the modes of thought and argument characteristic of that milieu.&rdquo;<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Blair acknowledges that a &ldquo;spate of recent work&rdquo; has begun to &ldquo;uncover the culturally specific practices of note taking in various European contexts ranging especially from antiquity to the eighteenth century.&rdquo; Through this research, we learn about ancient bookkeeping, Biblical lists, commonplacing, readers&rsquo; use of notes as a means of dialoguing with texts and authors, the outsourcing of annotation, collective note-taking practices, and changing conceptions of note taking as a means of either strengthening or externalizing memory.</span></p>

	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font: 12px Garamond; min-height: 13px;"">
	But what about the <i>new</i> everyday? Despite the fact that the cultural context for note-taking, and the materials about which and with which we take notes, have changed dramatically since the eighteenth century, Blair says, &ldquo;there is little [work] so far that addresses how note taking is changing as new tools have become and continue to become available, from the Post-it to the highlighter to software programs and the Palm Pilot.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font: 12px Garamond;"">
	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">&nbsp;Education scholars often examine the pedagogy of note-taking, and some social scientists, especially those whose work focuses on aging and memory, have studied list-making. But few of these formal studies address the new materiality of notes and lists. It seems fitting that those heeding Blair&rsquo;s call to action are debating the new digital tools of note-taking <i>through </i>some of those very tools. A group of tech-savvy academic bloggers &ndash; the <a href=""http://chronicle.com/section/About-ProfHacker/439/""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><i>ProfHacker</i></span></a><i> </i>collective &ndash; has sparked lively discussions about <a href=""http://chronicle.com/blogPost/How-Do-You-Organize-and/23839/""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">annotation software</span></a>; personal note-managing databases like <a href=""http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Take-a-Minute-to-Collect-Yo/24020/""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Evernote</span></a>; note-taking, outlining, and writing programs like <a href=""http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Scrivener-Scrivening-Scri/23026/""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Scrivener</span></a>; and to-do list managers like <a href=""http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Putting-the-THINGS-in-GTD-/22908/""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Things</span></a>.

	In this cluster of <i>The New Everyday</i> we examine new everyday inscriptions, both the scholarly and the utterly mundane &ndash; from the grocery list to the collaboratively organized and annotated archive. The nine essays in this cluster focus on notes both physical and virtual, found and made, formal and informal, collaboratively and individually created, means-to-ends and ends-in-themselves. We begin with <b>Heidi Wilkins&rsquo;</b> description of SP-ARK, filmmaker Sally Potter&rsquo;s online documentation of her filmmaking process, and the participatory processes through which users navigate and annotate &ldquo;pathways&rdquo; through the collection, thereby animating the archive. Users, Wilkins suggests, &ldquo;increase the significance of the already valuable items featured on SP-ARK by adding their personal notes and ideas.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font: 12px Garamond; min-height: 13px;"">
	The scholarly <i>value</i> of notes and other everyday inscriptions is a question at the center of <b>Dan Cohen&rsquo;s</b> essay. Cohen examines the &ldquo;calculus of importance&rdquo; behind the Library of Congress&rsquo;s decision to archive all public Tweets created since 2006. He argues that the resources and effort expended to secure what some might regard as a &ldquo;mass of worthless and mundane musings&rdquo; is well worth it, considering the cost of archiving tweets compared to the expense of storing physical media &ndash; and bearing in mind the potential historical value today&rsquo;s digital ephemera might have for future historians.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font: 12px Garamond; min-height: 13px;"">
	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">&nbsp;</span><b>Katie Harvey</b> then describes another collectively-constructed collection that, although perhaps not (yet) of interest to the L.O.C., is of tremendous importance to the fan community that created it and to those whose life&rsquo;s work it documents. Harvey discusses the analog-to-digital evolution of Grateful Dead &ldquo;shared tape&rdquo; lists, which generated their own notational language and elaborate listing protocols and which, over time, have come to codify not only the history of the Dead, but also &ldquo;the history and future of [its fan] community.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font: 12px Garamond; min-height: 13px;"">
	While the language and protocols of Harvey&rsquo;s lists are meant to make tape sharing accessible and intelligible to a wide community, other types of list-making and note-taking needn&rsquo;t make sense to anyone but the list-maker. As <b>John Thompson</b> explains in his examination of the grocery list, the seeming informality and triviality of these lists often belies a complex, culturally-informed selection, sorting, and inscription process. The grocery list can serve as a place where we negotiate between the competing rhetorics and ideologies of global agribusiness and genetic engineering, on the one hand, and &ldquo;slow food&rdquo; and localism, on the other. The mundane grocery list &ldquo;might take on a function of constitutive rhetoric,&rdquo; helping us define who we are as consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font: 12px Garamond; min-height: 13px;"">
	Do such personalized lists represent anything to anyone other than those who create them? <b>Laura Bergeron and Linda Levitt</b> consider how the found notes and lists posted to <a href=""http://www.foundmagazine.com/""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><i>Found Magazine</i></span></a><i> </i>can foster relationships between visitors, cryptic inscriptions, and their anonymous writers. In the comments section of the site, visitors often construct narratives about the imagined authors of these textual artifacts, and, in the process, occasionally learn something about themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font: 12px Garamond; min-height: 13px;"">
	While <i>Found&rsquo;</i>s commenters often use found lists to engage in amateur psychoanalysis of their imagined authors, scholars and curators can find tremendous research value in everyday lists uncovered in the archive. <b>Liza Kirwin</b> proposes that the myriad lists in the Smithsonian&rsquo;s Archives of American Art &ndash; from artists&rsquo; to-do lists to visual and verbal lists of artworks &ndash; can &ldquo;give insight into the list-maker&rsquo;s personal habits and enrich our understanding of individual biographies,&rdquo; or &ldquo;reveal the process by which [creative or mundane] decisions are made.&rdquo; Ad Reinhardt&rsquo;s graphic thumbnail listing of his black paintings, for instance, &ldquo;reveals their underlying geometry&rdquo; &ndash; an infrastructure hard to discern from their seemingly uniform surfaces. Some lists, like Alfred Konrad&rsquo;s picture list of the contents of his suitcase on a 1963 trip to Cairo, &ldquo;can be works of art in and of themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

At the same time, many of these creative explorations lead back to the <i>old </i>everyday of note-taking &ndash; <a href=""http://mollyspringfield.com/section/38675_The_Marginalia_Archive.html""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">marginalia</span></a>, <a href=""http://mollyspringfield.com/section/5898_Index_Cards.html""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">index cards</span></a>, the analogue <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikburke/sets/72157601762431785/""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">&ldquo;palm pilot&rdquo;</span></a>, the Moleskine (see video). <b>Lisa Gitelman</b> considers the old and new materialities of note-taking &ndash; and their aesthetics and politics &ndash; within the context of the archive. She argues that a small but significant apparatus of note-sorting, the paperclip, because of its tendency to puncture documents or stain them with rust, has been &ldquo;banished from the historical record,&rdquo; thereby obscuring one of the &ldquo;micro-logics by which bureaucratic labor collects and connects.&rdquo; The new everyday of email attachments and paperclip icons, she explains, alters the identities of and relationships between documents and their attachments. Looking back to various forms of the analogue paperclip, &ldquo;each in its ingenious intricate morphology,&rdquo; Gitelman suggests, can help us to consider a &ldquo;model of attachment on distinctive terms.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font: 12px Garamond; min-height: 13px;"">
	Morphologies are also central to <b>Andrew Piper</b>&rsquo;s exploration of the relationships between notes and books &ndash; a relationship that is changing as &ldquo;our notes and our books increasingly belong the same medium.&rdquo;&nbsp; He explores myriad writers&rsquo; conceptions of the note and their understanding of its role in visualizing the writing process, in making and undoing ideas, in advancing the &ldquo;metamorphosis surrounding composition,&rdquo; in materializing the relationship between writing and thought. Piper proposes that &ldquo;in a world of digital notes the printed book will continue to argue for the morphological nature of writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; font: 12px Garamond; min-height: 13px;"">
	<b>Kate Eichhorn</b>, who offers the final piece in this cluster, finds that her messy, overstuffed analogue day-timer makes just such an argument. As &ldquo;its guts lay bare a body torn apart by the need to live in many worlds,&rdquo; Eichhorn&rsquo;s planner reflects the poetics of her everyday life, its &ldquo;specific rhythm, visuality and structure of feeling.&rdquo; Despite feeling the pressure to join the digerati and adopt a Blackberry, Eichhorn considers the morphologies and materialities of both analogue and digital planners. In order for the Blackberry to win her over, it has to prove its value not simply as a &ldquo;tool for information management&rdquo; or a mnemonic device, but as a &ldquo;palimpsest of everyday practice and innovation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

	In the age of the BlackBerry, my August-to-August black vinyl covered pocket-sized book is already a relic. Like the sight of a clunky Sony Walkman at the gym, its function is still recognizable, but it&rsquo;s more likely to be read as an artifact than as a tool of information management. In classrooms and meetings, my day-timer and ritualized relationship to this book is even a topic of discussion. Colleagues and students remark upon my refined but seemingly inefficient system of information management. Why would someone with my schedule and range of administrative duties resist the temptation to adopt a more efficient technology? Why not splurge on a BlackBerry or iPhone? Of course, my day-timer is only a system of information management on the surface. Far more than a list of tasks, it&rsquo;s a deeply personalized altered book. Read closely, it tells the story of a life. Its guts lay bare a body torn apart by the need to live in many worlds -- or more accurately, many institutional contexts -- and because there is no delete function, there is no way to obscure the messiness of this life. On the inside front cover, a litany of numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		8 MTWF 3 10 11:40 MTWTF 6 W. Break F 8 or 12 (M and W) Winter (T and Th. M ( MTWTF 3 3000 4000 / Enr. # 2010000014367155 /gn.2019 Northside 7000 Berry and N. 1st 4000 USER ID + Part 1 (5000 + 24000) Part 2 (15000) rend deduc. $500 . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Times, dates, street addresses, pins, passwords, financial figures&mdash;as much as the names by which we are interpellated, these sums, codes and coordinates call us into being in a world where being itself is deeply entangled in a cycle of being accounted for and accountable to the institutions we invariably navigate in our everyday life. These numbers are part of what sociologist Dorothy Smith describes as the &ldquo;textual realities&rdquo; that both define who we are and place our actual experiences of everyday life under erasure: &ldquo;Textual realities are not fictions or falsehoods; they are normal, integral, and indeed essential features of the relations and apparatuses of ruling.&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;1&quot;]Dorothy Smith, The Conceptual Practices of Power: A Feminist Sociology of Knowledge (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1990), 83.[/fn]</p>
<p>
	Beyond the cover of my day-timer, the reader discovers other layers of the factual surfaces that structure my textual reality: places to be, people to meet, things to do. But here too is evidence of how I manage to &ldquo;make do&rdquo; within the institutional contexts I navigate on a daily basis. Completed tasks are marked by an exaggerated checkmark. Incomplete tasks are crossed out but usually rewritten, or simply circled and transferred with an arrow to another block of time or day. During especially chaotic periods, a day or entire week may be covered up with a new scrap of paper or series of sticky notes (sometimes one has no other option but to begin again). Finally, in the tradition of altered books, my day-timer is also an archive of other documents. On the occasion of writing this essay, I discover a dental insurance card, a sticker featuring the code to a long lost combination lock, an advertisement for a multifunction printer, three business cards, two invoices and a printed Google Map from here to somewhere else.</p>
<p>
	As evidenced by my day-timer, my life is one deeply mediated by texts and the textual realities of institutions, but day-timers and their lists may also tell other stories, including those that may on the surface appear to have little or no connection to texts at all. I grew up in a house with few books and with a father who appeared to rarely if ever write. Nevertheless, there were tiny notebooks stashed around the house. Small enough to fit in the pocket of a grubby pair of GWGs and not fall out into the field, these notebooks contained few if any words&mdash;they simply contained lists of numbers. Only years later while researching the history of ledger books would I come to appreciate that these cryptic lists of numbers were an archive of temperatures and yields and prices&mdash;an invaluable record of what was grown, with what results and at what cost. Writing this essay, a reflection on my own cursive hand in a &ldquo;BlackBerry field,&rdquo; I again recall these miniature notebooks with their cryptic numeric lists, but now understand them not simply as archives of work but also as lists inextricably linked to the fields in which they were written and meant to document, reminding me that lists can and do document all kinds of labor, including labor that appears to be carried out beyond the institutions and textual realities that govern my own life. Writing this essay has also given me occasion to reflect on the surprising ways in which these mysterious notebooks with their numeric lists overlap with my own day-timer. Neither the cryptic notebooks I recall from my childhood nor my day-timer constitutes a form of writing or an artifact with any obvious aesthetic qualities, but they are both deeply reflective of the poetics of everyday life. Lists, whether composed in institutions or fields, are marked by a specific rhythm, visuality and structure of feeling, and in either case, they reveal much about the writer&rsquo;s operativity in the world.</p>
<p>
	The concept of everyday life is ubiquitous, but its referents are as varied as life itself. The everyday has been used to theorize everything from the history of home appliances to television. While such objects or phenomena may be part of the everyday, I maintain that the everyday, as a conceptual category and something we actually experience, may be far less concrete despite its rootedness in material culture. To begin, &ldquo;The everyday is that which is most familiar,&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;2&quot;]Highmore, Everyday Life and Cultural Theory, 2.[/fn] &ldquo;what lags and falls back, the residual life with which our trash cans and cemeteries are filled: scrap and refuse.&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;3&quot;]Maurice Blanchot quoted by Michael E.

Tomasik (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1988), 3.[/fn] &ldquo;Polyrythmia from the first listening,&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;10&quot;]Henri Lefebvre, Rhythmanalysis: Space, Time and Everyday Life (New York: Continuum, 2001), 16.

Ben Highmore, 238. [/fn] Read through these discursive traces culled from only a few of the theorists by whom my own understanding of the everyday is informed, the everyday evokes affects and desires, struggles and constraints and a certain degree of tension&mdash;productive tension. The everyday is not simply what is, then, but also what is forced to the surface, spills-over, bubbles up, makes itself known. The everyday is the banal that paradoxically insists upon being heard and seen, and the list is one of the places where this visible and audible banal is most apparent.</p>
<p>
	On this basis, I maintain that lists are not simply reflections of what we intend to do, carry out or fail to accomplish, but forms that map the flows, fits and starts, violent interruptions and gaps that mark our everyday lives. Form, as Charles Bernstein argues, may be simply understood as &ldquo;ways of putting things together, or stripping them apart . . . how any one of us interprets what&rsquo;s swirling so often incomprehensibly about us.&rdquo; If we further adopt Bernstein&rsquo;s definition of poetry as an &ldquo;aversion to conformity in pursuit of new forms,&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;15&quot;]Charles Bernstein, A Poetics (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992), 1. [/fn] without necessarily conflating the list with the list poem, it is possible to appreciate lists as a minor but ubiquitous form that offers itself up as a primary site of textual intervention&mdash;the most basic, most immediate, most familiar form available for manipulation, repetition, aversion and invention in the relentless flow of the everyday.</p>
<p>
	Michel de Certeau and Luce Girard maintain that culture &ldquo;is not information, but its treatment by a series of operations as a function of objectives and social relations.&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;16&quot;] Michel de Certeau and Luce Girard, The Practice of Everyday Life, Vol. 2, 254.[/fn] Recognizing that &ldquo;[t]he first aspect of these operations is aesthetic,&rdquo; they further emphasize that &ldquo;an everyday practice opens up a unique space within an imposed order, as does the poetic gesture that bends the use of common language to its own desire in a transforming reuse.&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;17&quot;]Ibid.[/fn] If &ldquo;everyday practice patiently and tenaciously restores a space for play, an interval of freedom, a resistance to what is imposed from a model, a system, or an order),&rdquo;[fn value=&quot;18&quot;] Ibid., 255.[/fn] a poetics of everyday life is no more or no less a theory of how we make do, how we carve out small spaces of pleasure within the constraints of our daily grinds. Perhaps, if I hesitate to abandon my inefficient day-timer for a more efficient electronic prosthetic, it&rsquo;s because I have yet to understand how these new devices will adequately serve me not simply as tools of information management but as forms ripe for aversion, play and pleasure&mdash;not mere mnemonic devices but palimpsests of everyday practice and innovation. What better companion and accomplice for one&rsquo;s labor, after all, than a messy, corporeally embedded scene of operativity?</p>

	A good biographical list provides a compact personal narrative from the point of view of he compiler. &nbsp;In 1927, journalist H. L. Mencken (1800&ndash;1956) wrote a letter about his personality traits entirely in the form of a list from 1 to 29.</p>
<p class=""img-center"">
	<img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/mencken.preview.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Number 4 reads: &ldquo;Curiously enough, I greatly dislike the common American dirty stories, and avoid the men who tell them habitually. They seem dull to me. I love the obscene, but it must have wit in it&rdquo;; and no. 10: &ldquo;If I ever marry, it will be on a sudden impulse, as a man shoots himself.&rdquo; He sent this list-letter to artist and writer Charles Green Shaw (1892&ndash;1974) for his book <i>The Low Down</i>, a collection of celebrity portraits.&nbsp; Mencken was an acerbic critic of American life and long-time writer for the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>, and his lively list lays bare his opinionated prose style, but it also provides an intimate view of his follies and foibles. Shaw published it nearly verbatim. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
	<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""line-height: 17px;"">Before the age of computers and easily updated electronic lists, artists such as Philip Evergood (1900&ndash;1973)&nbsp; kept current by manually adding information to his typed &ldquo;master&rdquo; r&eacute;sum&eacute;.&nbsp; When it was barely readable, a new &ldquo;master&rdquo; was typed.&nbsp; He saved the earlier versions.&nbsp; The density of the emendations was proof of his ability to survive and thrive as an artist.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""img-center"">
	<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""line-height: 17px;"">While individuals often pad their r&eacute;sum&eacute;, stretching their skills and experience, painter and theorist Ad Reinhart (1913&ndash;1967) elevated the expanded r&eacute;sum&eacute; to a fine art.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the mid-1960s he set down in his elegant and distinctive calligraphy a detailed list of his life&rsquo;s events.&nbsp; Beginning with his birth in 1913, he inserts major art historical happenings, such as the 1913 Armory Show, the first international exhibition of modern art in the United States, into his life story.&nbsp; The list, on 8 x 11&rdquo;, onion-skin pages, cut and taped together, is four feet high.&nbsp; In this tall tale, Reinhardt&rsquo;s life story and the history of art become one in the same.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
	<img align=""right"" border=""0"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/catlin.preview.jpg"" style=""margin-left: 10px; width: 280px; height: 338px;"" /><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">There are perhaps more name lists in the Archives than any other kind of list.&nbsp; These include membership lists, mailing lists, lists of models, lists of invited guests, and the like.&nbsp; In 1830s, painter George Catlin (1796&ndash;1872), who recorded American Indian culture through portraits and scenes from daily life, kept a list of English translations of Indian names from the various tribes; for instance <i>Ah&#39;-sho-cole</i>, from his list, means &ldquo;Rotten Foot&rdquo; in Pawnee. Catlin painted <i>Ah&#39;-sho-cole, </i>a noted Pawnee warrior, in 1834.&nbsp; The list represents Catlin&rsquo;s efforts to accurately represent his subjects.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
	Painter Ludwig Sander (1906&ndash;1975) kept an early, if not the first membership list of The Club, a postwar group of New York artists legendary for its polemic discussions. <img align=""left"" border=""0"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/sander.preview.jpg"" style=""margin-right: 10px; width: 212px; height: 263px;"" />The list reminds us that someone had to keep track of who was who, and where they were, for scheduling meetings.&nbsp; Sander doodled in the margins, perhaps passing time while phoning members.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;The Archives&rsquo; most notable name list is Pablo Picasso&rsquo;s (1881&ndash;1973) recommendations for the 1913 Armory Show. <img align=""right"" border=""0"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/picasso.preview.jpg"" style=""margin-left: 10px;"" />Walt Kuhn, who played a major role in assembling the show, had limited knowledge of the European avant-garde. He relied on American artists then living abroad, as well as Europeans in the know, such as Picasso, for introductions to contemporary European artists and dealers. With phonetic spelling, Picasso names Marcel Duchamp, whose Nude Descending a Staircase (1912) would cause an uproar in the American press, Fernand L&eacute;ger, and the Spaniard Juan Gris, among others. Curiously, he did not include his collaborator and fellow cubist Georges Braque, whose name was later added in Kuhn&rsquo;s hand. In the end, the Europeans stole the show, overshadowing their American counterparts. The list reveals something of the process of organizing this transcontinental exhibition. Opinions were sought, lists were made, and selections were finalized to represent the best modern art at that moment.</p>
<p>
	One of the most visually impressive name lists is Ray Johnson&rsquo;s (1927&ndash;1995) photocopied list of people who posed for his &ldquo;silhouette portraits&rdquo;. <img align=""left"" border=""0"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/johnson.preview.jpg"" style=""margin-right: 10px; width: 360px; height: 577px;"" /><br />
	Johnson is best known for his enigmatic collages and as the founder of the New York Correspondance [intentional misspelling] School, an international network of poets and artists who exchanged artwork through the postal system. Between 1976 and 1982, he made silhouette portraits and kept a list of the people who &ldquo;kindly posed.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is unclear if he actually made silhouettes of everyone listed, or if the list sent through the mail was the art event.&nbsp; The names are a who&rsquo;s who of the famous and not-so-famous&mdash;an art-world jumble with Johnson as the only common denominator.&nbsp; Johnson sent this list to another &ldquo;Johnson,&rdquo; art historian Ellen Johnson, as a thank you for participating in his project. (In a subsequent list of silhouette portraits dated 1979, Ellen Johnson&rsquo;s name appears at number 207.)</p>

	3. To-dos</h4>
<p>
	<img align=""left"" border=""0"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/weinman.preview.jpg"" style=""margin-right: 10px; width: 253px; height: 316px;"" />To-dos are often the most substantive lists.&nbsp; They tell us what we have done or what we hope to do.&nbsp; They help us organize our time.&nbsp; They focus our attention forward, instilling confidence in our ability to complete tasks and move on.&nbsp; When Adolph A. Weinman (1870&ndash;1952) established his own sculpture studio in New York in 1904, he practiced the Beaux-Arts style of his teachers&mdash;Olin Levi Warner, Charles Henry Niehaus and others&mdash;characterized by classical forms, symmetry, rich ornamentation, and grand scale. Weinman&rsquo;s works conveyed weighty themes&mdash;duty, purity, love, liberty, repentance&mdash;through lightly veiled allegories. He made a to-do list of possible compositions such as, &ldquo;make David either in the act of throwing stone or picking up stone,&rdquo; and &ldquo;make St. George on horseback pushing sword into scabbard.&rdquo;&nbsp; For Weinman, the moment of greatest emotional impact was the just before felling Goliath or just after slaying the dragon.&nbsp; While he was a prolific architectural sculptor for such firms as McKim, Mead, and White, there is no evidence that he completed these projects.</p>
<p>
	On August 16, 1961, architect Eero Saarinen (1910&ndash;1961) made a to-do list of 53 tasks&mdash;from the exceptional, &ldquo;discuss master plan of Chicago,&rdquo; to the everyday, &ldquo;fix light in living room&rdquo;.&nbsp; Saarinen, who designed such structural icons as the TWA terminal (1962) at JFK International Airport in New York and the Gateway Arch in St. Louis (1965), was a great list maker and a consummate multitasker. While most of his lists are to-dos, he was also fond of enumerating his second wife&rsquo;s good qualities&mdash; &ldquo;generous, attractive, amusing, intelligent, talented, love-able, constructive, creative&rdquo; in red pencil, with hearts, or noting in Roman numerals best-to-worst-case scenarios (including the time-line for his divorce from is first wife).&nbsp; Five days after he wrote his August 16th to-do, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor.&nbsp; Ten days later he was dead from complications of surgery.&nbsp; Saarinen was 51 and busy with major architectural projects, as well as his home renovations. The list remains as evidence of tasks left forever undone.</p>

<p>
	Janice Lowry&rsquo;s (1946&ndash;2009) to-do lists are among the most engaging in the Archives. An introspective assemblage artist, she kept a journal for nearly forty years that filled 126 bound volumes, many elaborately illustrated and all peppered with to-dos&mdash;&ldquo;make plane res/car/hotel,&rdquo; &ldquo;mail announcements,&rdquo; &ldquo;get rain gutters&rdquo;.</p>
<p class=""img-center"">
	<img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/lowry_1.preview.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	The recurrent tasks, such as &ldquo;pay bills,&rdquo; are interspersed with her dream recollections and random thoughts, each page thick with collaged images, paint, stamps and stickers&mdash;a vivid backdrop for her daily chores.&nbsp; The lists propel her forward from one day to the next.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Lowry also used lists as a kind of self-help therapy to articulate problems and sort out her feelings. Such to-do lists as &ldquo;people I need to forgive,&rdquo; which had some overlap with her list of &ldquo;fifty angry grievances,&rdquo; helped her examine personal issues and work toward a resolution.</p>
<h4>
	4. Inventories</h4>
<p>
	Art dealers, registrars, and executors of artists&rsquo; estates are in a constant state of tracking works of art&mdash;lists of works for sale, lists of works in the studio, lists of works in storage.&nbsp; In the late 1940s, art dealer Germain Seligmann (1893&ndash;1978) made numerous lists of family treasures and gallery stock in Paris that had been seized and sold by order of the pro-Nazi Vichy government during World War II. His lists of tapestries, silver, porcelains, and drawings were part of his legal claim to retrieve stolen property.</p>
<p>
	While most inventories are fairly routine, in the hands of artists, an illustrated inventory can document the art-making process and even become a work of art in and of itself.&nbsp; Perhaps only an artist would make a graphic list like Adolf Konrad&rsquo;s (1915&ndash;2003), showing, in picture form, the contents of his suitcase on a trip to Cairo in December 1963.</p>
<p class=""img-center"">
	<img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/konrad.preview.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	In 1932, painter and color theorist Oscar Bluemner (1867&ndash;1938) made an illustrated list of his recently completed landscape paintings, including thumbnail sketches with information about the dimensions, date, media, and in some cases the subject of each work of art.</p>
<p class=""img-center"">
	<img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/bluemner_0.preview.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	His list is a graphic catalogue, a snapshot of his current production, though one wonders about Bluemners&rsquo; state of mind.&nbsp; The crowded page, as well as his habit of appending one list to another with shorthand marks and abbreviations, tends to obfuscate rather than clarify his inventory.</p>
<p>
	Ad Reinhardt (whose r&eacute;sum&eacute; is above) was known for his radical, achromatic black paintings. From the mid-1950s until his death, he painted almost exclusively with black. He made a graphic list of black paintings for a major retrospective of his work at The Jewish Museum in New York City in 1966.</p>
<p class=""img-center"">
	<img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/reinhardt.preview.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	<p""> In his thumbnail sketches, Reinhardt reveals their underlying geometry, the direction of the brush strokes that give minimal form to the black surface.</p""></p>
<h4>
	5. Word lists</h4>
<p>
	Word lists, or a vocabulary piled up through free association, reveal the list maker&rsquo;s thought process.&nbsp; Painter and feminist Joan Snyder (b. 1940) made a list of words defining &ldquo;female sensibility.&rdquo; Her list, written in hot pink felt-tip pen, provides a layering of meaning and richness to a larger concept.</p>
<p class=""img-center"">
	<img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/snyder.preview.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	In 1951, Ad Reinhardt made a list of ―undesirable words‖ and ―more adequate words‖ for ―art,‖ as well as a list of ―dualisms.‖ He was deeply interested in Eastern philosophy, favoring words for art that were intellectually and emotionally expansive, for example, ―consciousness,‖ freedom,‖ and ―imagination.‖.</p>
<p class=""img-center"">
	<img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/reinhardt_scrivener_1.preview.jpg"" /><img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/reinhardt_scrivener_2.preview.jpg"" /><img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/reinhardt_scrivener_3.preview.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	Unlike the binary oppositions fundamental to Western thought, Reinhardt understood duality as a philosophy of balance, where two opposites coexist in harmony and are able to transmute into each other&mdash;the yin and yang of all things.</p>
<p>
	Sculptor Robert Morris (b. 1931) avoided making formal statements about his work; instead, he raised provocative questions about the essence of art.&nbsp; In a 1967 postcard to curator Samuel J. Wagstaff, Morris listed alternative language for the new term &ldquo;earthworks,&rdquo; a form of art created in nature that uses natural materials such as soil and stones.</p>
<p>
	With his invented word and phrases&mdash;&ldquo;Dirt art. Dirty art. Bogs, Geometic quagmires.&nbsp; Square swamps&rdquo;&mdash;Morris neither criticizes nor endorses the movement, but plays with the nebulous border separating the untouched earth&mdash;&ldquo;at her fatuous flat chested best&rdquo;&mdash;from one that is manipulated by the artist.&nbsp; Both Morris&rsquo;s and Reinhardt&rsquo;s lists underscore the limits of language to define something as elusive as art.</p>
<h4>
	Conclusions</h4>
<p>
	Lists, whether dashed off as a quick reminder or carefully constructed as a comprehensive inventory, give insight into the list maker&rsquo;s personal habits and enrich our understanding of individual biographies. They reveal the process by which decisions are made, or show the winnowing down of an argument to its essential points.&nbsp; In the hands of artists, lists can even be works of art in and of themselves.</p>

<p>
	On August 28, 2010, my partner, a friend, and I drove from our home in Charlottesville, VA to attend the Reclaim the Dream rally in Washington, D.C. to commemorate the 47th anniversary of Martin Luther King, Jr.&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;I Have a Dream Speech.&rdquo; This rally, organized by Al Sharpton&rsquo;s National Action Network, was called in response to Glenn Beck&rsquo;s Restoring Honor rally that was being held on the National Mall, the same site as King&rsquo;s original speech.</p>
<p>
	Beck claimed that his choice of August 28 was a divine coincidence, and that he hadn&rsquo;t intentionally chosen to hold his rally on the same day as King&rsquo;s speech. However, what I witnessed of Beck&rsquo;s rally assured me that it was explicitly designed to replace the set of signs and symbols associated with King&rsquo;s speech with a new set of signs and symbols in the national imaginary.</p>
<p>
	Specifically, Beck&rsquo;s rally was designed to extend the fantasy of the U.S. as a wounded national homeland that was propagated by the State after the events of 9/11. The most haunting image of this fantasy was the face of the final speaker at Beck&rsquo;s rally, David Roever, a Vietnam veteran and preacher, who offered a closing benediction. As Beck told the audience, Roever was heinously disfigured during the Vietnam War when a phosphorus grenade that he had intended to throw at the enemy exploded in his hand.</p>
<p>
	Beck regaled the crowd with the story of how Roever, recovering in a military hospital and suffering from excruciating pain, buried his face in his pillow to hide his tears, only to realize when he turned over that the skin on his face had literally ripped off. The goal of Beck&rsquo;s rally was to replace Martin Luther King, Jr.&rsquo;s face, standing in here as a proxy for Barack Obama&rsquo;s face, with David Roever&rsquo;s face as the face of the nation.</p>
<p>
	Such a fantastic displacement was intended, in turn, to replace Obama&rsquo;s hopeful national agenda with a melancholic one unable to accept its loss of symbolic privilege. I can think of no more potent example of the right wing&rsquo;s attempt to shift the national imaginary back to a pre-Obama everyday than the fantastic distortions that took place at Beck&rsquo;s rally.<br />

	Just moments after the polls closed in New York State, Carl Paladino, the Republican candidate for Governor, took to the podium to deliver his concession speech to now Governor-elect Andrew Cuomo. Armed with a bright orange baseball bat, he growled that he had promised to take a baseball bat to Albany&hellip; that the bat was his metaphor for the people and that now Cuomo could take the bat with him or ignore it at his peril. Posing with the bat &ndash; and he was certainly posing for the camera &ndash; he threatened rather than congratulated Cuomo with a menacing, bat-wielding stare. This was not a concession, this was an aggressive and explicit threat.&nbsp; However, while Paladino&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mad as Hell&rdquo; routine may have allowed him to roll over Rick Lazio in the Republican primary, it did not play well with the majority of voters in the Empire State. He lost by almost thirty points; few New Yorkers, it seems, wanted to be the bat. &nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Indeed, the bat seems like an odd metaphor employed in this way.&nbsp; This is a thug&rsquo;s bat, not a child&rsquo;s toy or an emblem of America&rsquo;s favorite pastime.&nbsp; Paladino&rsquo;s loss was a bright spot for me on a devastating election night. His politics of anger may have been a successful early rallying cry for the Tea Party, but it was not a winning electoral strategy. Similarly, Sharron Angle, Christine O&rsquo;Donnell, and Linda McMahon all lost their bids in part, I think, because they could not articulate platforms beyond the bat or the batty.&nbsp; Yet one third of Tea Party candidates, many with more fully articulated platforms than O&rsquo;Donnell, Angle, or Paladino, did win elections in other states in campaigns often funded by a handful of behind the scenes billionaires.&nbsp; These are the aggressive and explicit threats we need to take seriously. This isn&rsquo;t crazy Carl with a baseball bat or Christine O&rsquo;Donnell with a broomstick.&nbsp; These mad-as-hell candidates &ndash; and their wealthy patrons &ndash; may very well succeed in overturning the health care bill, passing laws for fetal personhood, and further paralyzing the Democratic Senate and the Obama White House. &nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	In the past few days a number of people have sent me the link to the website http://whatthefuckhasobamadonesofar.com/.&nbsp; Each time you visit the site it lists something that the Obama administration has actually accomplished. These include achievements such as &ldquo;Signed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, giving the FDA the authority to regulate the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of tobacco for the first time&rdquo;; &ldquo;Appointed more openly gay workers to government positions&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, restoring basic protections against pay discrimination for women and other workers.&rdquo; Most of these statements end with the tag line, &ldquo;Big fucking deal, what else?&rdquo;&nbsp; But these are big fucking deals.&nbsp; However, they&rsquo;ve been lost in the media hysteria over the Tea Party and its followers. &nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	It is time for the left to get mad as hell and to fight back, not with baseball bats but armed with the rhetoric that articulates legislative accomplishments that have improved the lives of middle class and working class Americans.<br />

	You can spend weeks wandering the vast mediascape and not see a sea of middle-aged, middle-American whiteness like a Tea Party rally.&nbsp; Over the past fifty years, partly out of political concern, partly out of some desire to accurately represent the changing face of America, but mostly in an attempt to reach as broad an audience as possible, the culture industry has largely rejected such bland homogeneity. The starring roles in most hit dramas still go to the straight white guy and girl, but the show would seem incomplete without a couple co-stars of a different color. And while whites still dominate positions of factual authority in the mass media, every local newscast has their &ldquo;other&rdquo; anchor.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been a long journey from the novelty of Nat King Cole in the mid 1950s to the routinized multi-hued casting of&nbsp; a show like today&rsquo;s Survivor, but what the American audience watches, and thus how they see their world and imagine its possibilities, has been irrevocably altered. &ldquo;Difference&rdquo; is no longer different, and diversity, albeit in its most banal form, is what Americans have come to expect. Beneath this ethereal media rainbow there used to be places were one might reliably find jowly white guys playing prominent roles, one of them being the nation&rsquo;s capital. Then came the Obama not-so-White House.<br />
	<br />
	&ldquo;Take our country back!&rdquo; is a cry you&rsquo;ll hear at a Tea Party protest. Back. Back to a time when white people were firmly in power and those of other ethnicities knew their place.&nbsp; But also back to an imaginary America that was almost entirely white as well. Back to <em>Leave it to Beaver</em>, <em>My Three Sons</em>, and <em>The Waltons</em>. But Fred MacMurray no longer has cultural currency; today&rsquo;s media fantasies are in living color. Tea Party rallies &ndash; the costumes, the outrage, the provocative rhetoric -- are so theatrical because they are theatre: a way for a dying strain of white people to represent themselves in a mediated world that no longer recognizes them. &nbsp;<br />

	For all the ballyhoo about the Tea Party and its potential impact on the future direction of America, the reality is that its influence will almost certainly be minimal.&nbsp; And the irony is that this became reality almost the very minute that the Republicans jumped on the bandwagon.<br />
	<br />
	Even though Tea Party leaders are seeking to flex their muscles now that the election is over, they will be mostly shut out of the Republican leadership and will struggle to enact their legislative agenda.&nbsp; Incoming Speaker of the House John Boehner embraced the Tea Party during this past election cycle, but his platform for legislative change, &ldquo;A Pledge to America,&rdquo; is essentially a rehash of the Contract with America that Newt Gingrich proposed in 1994.&nbsp; Boehner is neither proposing nor endorsing new ideas (though he has given them a &ndash; slightly &ndash; different title page). One third of Tea Party candidates won election, which would mark a highly significant movement of a third party. However, although the Tea Party originated as a grassroots movement spurred on by disenchanted citizens meeting at the local Starbucks or Applebees, the Republican Party craftily coopted its energy as a symbol of dissatisfaction with the legislative agenda of the Democratic-led Congress and White House.&nbsp; Photographs of the House leadership focus on Boehner, Eric Cantor, and Kevin McCarthy, all of whom were happy to capitalize on Tea Party rhetoric during the election but none of whom are actually closely aligned with the movement itself. &nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Tea Party candidates, for the most part, ran on Republican Party lines and the reality is that most Tea Partiers who won election will be new to Congress and will not have plum committee assignments.&nbsp; Michelle Bachmann, a leading voice of the Tea Party at rallies and especially on cable television, has fundraising clout and is seeking a leadership role among House Republicans, but she is given very little chance to actually win that role. And while Dick Armey and Sarah Palin may try to wield power through the medium of cable television, neither of them any longer holds political office and there isn&rsquo;t another election for them to influence for another two years. &nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Consider how difficult it has been for President Obama to enact the legislative goals he articulated in his campaign for President &ndash; and he was trying to do so while the Democrats controlled all of Congress.&nbsp; There is always a wide gap between campaign rhetoric and legislative action. The Tea Party may have evolved into a powerhouse in this campaign because Republican leaders adopted its rhetoric as a means of attacking Democratic leadership.&nbsp; But that very embrace is what threatens to delimit the Tea Party&rsquo;s impact. Unless they learn how to be effective legislators who can win over their colleagues through persuasion and compromise and not through expressions of anger, Tea Partiers risk marginalization at the hands of the Republican Party itself.</p>

	Looking from over the Canadian border (from a country obsessed with the USA, as was Britain in its own way), this political phenomenon seems largely manufactured by the media and, as such, all too &quot;real.&quot; If you know what I mean. They will surely get tons of attention and power with the election. They (meaning a very loose and contentious semi-coalition formed largely by a few venal right wingers with money and by the media) will surely attack each other from within and not last very long as a coalition, if one can even say they are.<br />
	<br />
	That said, I couldn&#39;t agree more about the suggestion about how naive the &quot;left&quot; (whatever that means in a place like the US; I really don&#39;t know any more) has been routinely about how power works and what to do about non-progressive political ideologies and the forces that wield them.<br />
	<br />
	There is no &quot;left&quot; left except a bunch of liberals like us who want to maintain our lifestyles and won&#39;t really take any risks.&nbsp; No one knows how to take risks any more--late capitalism has made any sense that there is a clear opposition or a clear way to oppose what goes on obscure.<br />
	<br />
	The only people I can see really making a difference in a progressive sense are those who buck the system by going to places where people really need help. It seems to me there are more and more entrepreneurial young people willing to do this. Working within established systems these days seems a dead end.</p>

	I have to admire some of the people on the street attaching themselves to the &quot;tea party&quot; banner. They are right to be angry. They are at least taking action. They are, in my opinion, completely and totally wrong-headed about the actual politics embedded in the action--as usual they have bought the line that will defeat their very own interests (Reagan and Thatcher had that down).&nbsp; The so-called leaders I loathe in a way I can only remember feeling at the depths of Reagan&#39;s tenure when he blatantly lied about the &quot;weapons&quot; in Nicaragua and Bush&#39;s tenure when he had Colin Powell blatantly lie about the &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; in Iraq.</p>
<p>
	Well, the motley &quot;coalition&quot; that the media and big-money manipulators are calling the Tea Party seems to have gained momentary &quot;power&quot; in the Congress. Perhaps now the irony of people running for GOVERNMENT positions on a platform of being ANTI-GOVERNMENT will come to roost. They will see just how hard it is to get anything done. Here is where the weight of the dead hand of bureaucracy will turn in favor of progressives!<br />
	Otherwise, if there is a progressive coalition, it (we) must look to their strategies of firing people up. And please, people, can we stop blaming Obama? Is it his fault he didn&#39;t turn out to be the &quot;second coming&quot;?</p>

	The New Everyday is a Media Commons project designed to be a reflection space on how everyday life has (and has not) been transformed since the theorizing of the 1980s by Stuart Hall and Michel de Certeau. It&#39;s purpose is to serve as a space of public reflection before (or instead of) the print/refereed publication.</p>
<p>
	Hall&#39;s impulse to this project was what he called &quot;The Great Moving Right Show,&quot; or more academically put, Thatcherism&#39;s hegemonic project. It&#39;s easily forgotten now but the analysis of Thatcherism was widely derided at the time, with people on the left insisting that this was simply old fashioned class politics in a slightly dressed up format; that Thatcher was stupid and by extension people were being stupid to vote for her.</p>
<p>
	Is this starting to sound familiar yet?</p>
<p>
	I wonder what you think of the Tea Party and the 2010 election-- it&#39;s been all about them. Let&#39;s consider the phenomenon. Is this a media manufactured movement? One paid for entirely by a small group of rich propagandists like the Koch brothers? Or is this another Moving Right Show, another hegemonic project? How might critical engagements begin to do this work of making distinctions?</p>
<p>
	Rather than wait for the usual academic process, I&#39;m hoping we might start a discussion immediately. This cluster will discuss what has happened, how we might respond, where we go next.</p>
<p>
	The results are in but there is no consensus as to what happened. Some see this as the start of a New Right; others as a passing distraction; others still as a convenient figleaf for corporate America.</p>
<p>
	Whatever the political conclusions, the media context has clearly changed. Whereas in 2008, the internet benefitted the Obama campaign, it&#39;s been Sarah Palin that has ruled Twitter in 2010. With the Glenn Beck/Fox News/Rush Limbaugh trifecta, old and new media have worked well for the Tea Party.</p>

	<strong>Distraction Span: Technologies of engagement and opportunities for productive disruption</strong></p>
<p>
	With this cluster of The New Everyday we initiate a conversation about social media that sidesteps the panic over youth and digital distraction while not being afraid to look head-on at their everyday engagements with mobile devices and social networking. We look to and include actual media practices to dispel the common diagnosis that networked media is rewiring young minds, displacing valuable forms of engagement, and making sustained reflection a thing of the past. Our aim is to challenge pathologizing discourses that frame young users of social media as simultaneously victims and threat (the teen who doesn&#39;t listen, who won&#39;t concentrate, who will fail to learn).</p>
<p>
	At the same time, we want to acknowledge that adults and youth can work together to make better sense and use of the interruptions, disturbances, and amusements introduced by new media. For instance, multitasking, fragmented and interlaced communication fostered by the culture of new media are undeniably novel and often challenging, especially in the classroom. Unlike television, digital media are integrated into work, school, and everyday life in ways that make them much harder for all people, and especially kids, to turn off or limit. Mobile media have also become requisite tools of productivity and social inclusion. Thus, the &quot;danger&quot; of distraction today isn&#39;t the lure of passivity, but relentless opportunities and demands for interaction even in the places where focus and introspection might be most useful.</p>
<p>
	There is also something old about the panic over new forms of media, the perceived detriment they pose to learning and thinking, and the use of young people as the heralds for and focus of this alarm. As the uses of mobile devices and platforms like texting, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube have grown to occupy significant amounts of time, it has become a challenge to grasp the diverse types of activities and conversations they actually hold and the types of connections they foster (as well as those they might displace or disrupt). One thing is certain though, schools and institutions of higher education have always faced a challenge in attempting to narrow and discipline students&rsquo; attention. And it&#39;s fair to say that learning is as much a result of resistance to discipline as it is the acceptance of a disciplining of focus. Successful education engages attention at points and encourages it to roam broadly at others. How does technology figure into this equation: what ways can it help us corral and disperse attention, and how does it hinder our efforts? And, how do we manage the clash between the distractions of continuous interleaved modes of communication and adults&rsquo; expectations about localized attention and social engagement?</p>
<p>
	Our best guess is that no simple correction or application (app) will come to light or be invented, rather people adapt multiple mechanisms of coping and achieving, and these emerge from everyday engagement with social media. In order to be able to identify and share these, we need more discussion about the differences in the ways people have taken to living and teaching within persistent and ubiquitous media environments. We need to share best case scenarios and worst. The contributors to this cluster describe their attempts to grapple with and adjust to the landscape of newly distributed attention.</p>
<p>
	We hope that this cluster will provoke both sustained reflection as well as disjointed rapid-fire thought on the topic. The discussion begins with our contributors who offer views on how diverse forms of sociality via networked media interface with the space of learning institutions. Elizabeth Losh reflects on a twitter experiment in an undergraduate course; Sara Harris considers uses of social media in journalism programs for underserved Los Angeles high school students; Lauren Berliner talks about the need to revamp media pedagogy to make it significant to a generation of vbloggers; Gina Lamb talks about mobile phones as &quot;home base&quot; for homeless LGBTQ youth; Asher Danziger advocates uses of digital media that creatively reclaim reflective thought, and Quinn Adney takes a leap off Facebook. Our contributors divert our attention to sites where the tension between focus and distraction is at play and consider both pedagogic strategies and community media projects that collaborate with and motivate youth to creatively and productively engage new media.</p>
<p>
	If multitasking is here to stay, if we are increasingly in many places at once, how can we as members of learning communities best be here and there simultaneously? We hope to use this cluster to begin an open conversation for educators and youth contributors to share what they have made and what they use, how they think about the media that surround them, and strategies they have developed to be productively distracted.</p>

	Facebook asks us to share and store our living memory in a virtual plane, so what I find myself wondering is, &quot;what happens to those memories if they are not recorded as everyone else&#39;s?&quot; &nbsp;To discover the answer to this question, I&#39;ve decided to take myself completely out of the equation and remove myself from Facebook. Five years of my life has been put on pause and temporarily erased.&nbsp;What lead me to take this leap was the feeling that Facebook is a distraction from life, taking from the physical world and giving to the virtual. This shift in power was never experienced by prior generations, so we are faced with the unprecedented challenge of incorporating the social networking site into daily life while not allowing it to take over.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	I figured my life would change, but I didn&#39;t realize the full extent until months down the road.&nbsp; <img src=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/dsc_4386.preview.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	I have looked into the eyes of multiple dates as I told them I have deactivated my Facebook account for an indefinite amount of time and observed the initial fear that follows my statement. &nbsp;New media and my generation can be likened to a parasite and its host. &nbsp;We are unable to survive without the other and yearn for greater technology and more fans or followers. Facebook has integrated itself into college life at even the most minuscule levels. Invitations to events and parties have almost completely moved to the digital realm. Word of mouth has become limited as students assume anyone who should attend an event already knows about it and has plans on attending. &nbsp;Why talk about something that doesn&rsquo;t need to be mentioned? &nbsp;Time is precious to any college student and Facebook allows time to speed up considerably. &nbsp;Why go on three dates with a person before finding out that they have irreconcilable differences in music taste or that he has a secret boyfriend that he never mentions? &nbsp;Instead, today&rsquo;s youth &ldquo;Facebook stalk&rdquo; someone and discover general information about the person that might not be revealed until much time passes. &nbsp;But is the Facebook version of a person an adequate representation of the actual human being? &nbsp;If I wanted to go online and tell the world that my favorite band is The Beatles and that my favorite activity is hiking, there is no reason to doubt my submission unless you know me prior. &nbsp;But a concern about truthfulness is usually overlooked for the sake of time. &nbsp;We trust Facebook to do the regular work of getting to know someone in a way we never would in a bar or at a party.</p>
<p>
	When I first deactivated my account, I was met with several attempts by Facebook to get me to stay on board, showing me pictures of who the social networking site believed to be close enough to me to be able to guilt me into staying. &nbsp;What Facebook doesn&rsquo;t know about me is that when I want something, I will break my arm if that means achieving my goal. &nbsp;I was leaving and there was nothing they could do to stop me. &nbsp;My initial feeling was excitement and freedom. &nbsp;I had done it! &nbsp;The next couple days felt like a withdrawal I had only seen in movies. &nbsp;I was addicted to Facebook and without it I was lost. &nbsp;My days felt empty and my fingers kept instinctually moving to the &ldquo;F&rdquo; on my keyboard. &nbsp;These symptoms lessened and within three weeks, it was normal to me that I didn&rsquo;t have Facebook. &nbsp;As far as I was concerned, I was never going back.&nbsp; <img src=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/img_2380.preview.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	Life undeniably moves slower without Facebook, but I don&rsquo;t view that as a negative fact. There are times when I would like to &ldquo;Facebook stalk&rdquo; someone before risking my emotions, but I keep telling myself that my parents did fine and they didn&rsquo;t even have cell phones when they met. &nbsp;Maybe I was born in the wrong generation, but I think this is the way it was meant to be. &nbsp;Life isn&rsquo;t meant to be easily controlled. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t pause, rewind, search or fast-forward life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;I first met the <em>Sexy Time in Dewey </em>vloggers in a weekly media workshop I designed as part of my dissertation research aimed to introduce San Diego LGBTQIA youth to video production as a means by which to critically engage with their own life experiences in the context of present and past media representations of Queer life. I arrived at the first session with a carload of equipment borrowed from local universities and a loose curriculum that, as flexible as it was, ultimately needed to be radically readjusted to make the workshop relevant to the young people who showed up to participate.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During our introductions I asked the participants if they had ever endeavored in any kind of media production. Tyler talked about appearing on-camera for his school&#39;s TV news program, Pacifica claimed not to have any experience, but when pressed, mentioned that she had made a slideshow for an English class assignment on <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, and Chris shyly suggested that she <em>may </em>have recorded videos of herself performing with her guitar. We were about an hour into the session when another youth from the group turned to them and asked, &quot;wait, don&#39;t you guys have a vlog?&quot; Chris responded, &quot;oh, yeah but that&#39;s something we just do when we hang out. It doesn&#39;t count.&quot; The group was convinced of this because they produce their video blog, <em>Sexy Time in Dewey</em> outside of any formal setting, at their own whim, using low-quality consumer technology (a still camera and Roxio software). While the group had never been explicitly discouraged from producing their blog, somewhere along the way they had received the message that spending time posting and commenting on YouTube is not part of the learning process and not only not worthwhile to mention in an educational setting, but something that might be construed by their instructors as a (perhaps embarrassing) waste of time.</p>
<p>
	<em>Sexy Time in Dewey </em>features seven high school seniors from a wealthy San Diego suburb, who, from within a Mitsubishi Montero (affectionately called &quot;Dewey&quot; for reasons none of the participants can recall or perhaps care to report), discuss the ways in which they are coming to understand and explore their sexual identities. In the spirit of a mobile &quot;coming out&quot; support group, the teens offer up their own experiences as guidance to other young viewers while demonstrating that it is possible to be open about one&#39;s sexuality and still find supportive friends.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vlog consists of episodes that are loosely organized around themes such as &quot;Resources,&quot; &quot;Labels,&quot; &quot;High School&quot; and &quot;Gay Straight Crushes.&quot; Chris Holmes, Dewey&#39;s owner and in all ways the driving force behind the series, typically initiates the conversation from the front seat while the still camera on her dashboard faces back at the others and records in a series of short clips. Someone in the car will ask a topical question like &quot;what&#39;s it like to be gay at school?&quot; and the others will earnestly work out their answers. Their analysis often comes through in their &ldquo;bloopers,&rdquo; amidst giggling and talking over each other. &quot;The only reason we are a minority is because there are so many people in the closet,&quot; Ashley concludes.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The teens occasionally fall out of the frame to lean on each other, conveying a familiarity and comfort with both themselves and the viewer&#39;s gaze that mitigates against the potential for the discussion to seem contrived or didactic. It&#39;s like getting a ride to your first day of school with a cool clique of upperclassmen who know the ropes and are excited to be the ones to help ease your transition. &quot;Ask us questions,&quot; they plea at the end of one episode. &quot;Give us ideas or comments! It&#39;s way too difficult to think of these things!&quot;</p>

<p>
	<em>Sexy Time in Dewey </em>is a timely contribution to the growing pool of online resources for struggling Queer youth in the recent wake of the highly publicized suicides of Billy Lucas, Tyler Clementi, and several others who had been bullied because they were perceived to be gay. Most notable has been the <em>It Gets Better</em> online video campaign (<a href=""http://www.itgetsbetter.com/"">www.itgetsbetter.com</a>) in which adults, many of whom are celebrities, give personal testimonies encouraging struggling youth to believe that their circumstances will eventually improve. First begun by syndicated columnist Dan Savage and his partner Terry Miller, the campaign now includes over 6,000 videos, including one by President Obama. While <em>It Gets Better</em> has been commended by many LGBTQIA advocates for helping to bring attention, inspiration, and resources to struggling teens, the project has also been critiqued for proliferating what Jasbin Puar has referred to as &quot;a mandate to fold into urban, neoliberal gay enclaves, a form of liberal handholding and upward-mobility that echoes the now discredited &#39;pull yourself up from the bootstraps&#39; immigrant motto.&quot; For these critics, <em>It Gets Better</em> suggests that teens should somehow <em>overcome</em> rather than confront the social and institutional structures that produce homophobia or take practical steps to improve one&#39;s circumstances and self-esteem (Doyle). As one <em>Sexy Time in Dewey </em>contributor put it, &quot;I&#39;m glad it gets better, but I don&#39;t want to have to wait until then. And in the meantime I don&#39;t want to have to want to kill myself for anyone to care.&quot; Hence their show.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The goal behind <em>Sexy Time in Dewey</em> has always been simple: &quot;speak to other gay kids.&quot; They are motivated by impulse rather than a pedagogical or political vision. They make episodes when it is convenient within their hangout schedule and if they are all in the car when someone happens to have a camera, they pick a topic and press record. There is no master plan, barely any effort to expand viewership beyond the 300-plus viewings per episode they already have, no agenda, and they have not sought out support or acknowledgement from their teachers or mentors at the community center.&nbsp;The <em>Sexy Time in Dewey </em>group came to my program already doing the kind of work I had hoped to begin with them. They are fulfilling the mission of the <em>It Gets Better</em> campaign to &quot;remind LGBT teens that they are not alone&quot; while also addressing many of its shortcomings. They are engaging in critical practices of self-examination, self-presentation and group dialogue and have taken on the self-assigned role of peer leaders without explicitly knowing or naming their practices as such. In their video discussions they work together to think through personal and community issues and take action by offering advice and concern to their peers. They form critical perspectives on controversial issues such as gay conversion therapy and offer advice and support to those who might be experiencing pressure to enter such a program.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, they are acquiring production skills through trial and error and developing their own style and structure informed by other shows they have seen. &nbsp;And their viewers are engaged in this learning process offering advice on technical skills such as how to obtain clearer audio when they record in the car.</p>
<p>
	Taking <em>Sexy Time in Dewey&#39;s </em>lead, I have shifted the goal of our workshop toward leveraging what the group and the other participants are <em>already</em> doing on their own. Rather than introducing new projects and instructing them how to use equipment that may not be relevant, we are learning how to use video recording and editing technologies and techniques that may enhance clarity and provide options if the group chooses to produce other kinds of media in the future. Together we are investigating how to increase viewership and enrich the dialogue that is already happening in the comments section while working towards understanding how their vlogging figures into the context of new media practice and the history of Queer advocacy and self-representation. Through my experience with the <em>Sexy Time in Dewey</em> vloggers I have come to recognize an imperative to shift media pedagogy toward recognizing distracted media practices as productive and to see their integration into curricula as an opportunity to guide youth toward using these tools to make critical and artistic interventions into everyday culture.</p>

In most public schools in Los Angeles, online access and new software and applications arrive in the classroom via corporate or philanthropic donations, if at all. In the public schools I have taught in, students have very limited opportunities to use computers as a group and in a context where a common goal guides the quest for digital expression and information-gathering. </span><br />

As such, the lab feels more like a bankrupt internet cafe -- a site of momentary access for condensed social or professional or gaming communication but no social networking-- than it does like a space for exploration and academic learning. Combine their usually brief school-based opportunities with the dearth of internet access on computers at homes and the proliferation of smart-phones (which are not ideal for academic research and writing) and for LAUSD students, you have a situation not unlike a hungry man invited to a full buffet who is told to use a saucer to serve himself instead of a dinner plate.

The fact that they were already inclined to share their phones and SMS photos and videos made the whole process of coordinating a large group with varying interests almost seamless. Creative distraction was something several of them used to and others craved.

Thus, adding media to required course work seems to provide a fun distraction, but not a quality forum for learning or expression. For these tools to move beyond a distraction in this setting, students need a culture of creative focus using tools they normally associated with distraction. To return to Jesse Nerio, who puts it best: &nbsp;&ldquo;It has to really do with students in school and the way they act toward computers and the energy they bring to school. That can change a lot, but that has to do with the teachers.&rdquo;</span><br />

	I have spent much of the last ten years offering digital arts workshops for LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay Bi-sexual, Transgender, and Questioning) youth at <a href=""http://www.reach.la"">REACH LA</a>, a youth driven non-profit organization in downtown Los Angeles. Providing a space for youth to explore creative expression through digital technologies has been an immensely rewarding experience and has opened my eyes to the important role that digital technologies play in the lives of these young people. They seem to have an innate sense of the importance of creating their own histories and families since mainstream society has failed LGBTQ youth in providing positive role models and safe spaces to find themselves.&nbsp; Digital technologies and mobile devices provide opportunities for these youth to connect with one another, share stories, and create safe social spaces where being gay is not just okay...it&rsquo;s the way to be.&nbsp; Technology is not a distraction for these youth, it is a lifesaver in their coming of age process. Rather than keeping them from deeper experiences and understandings, phones and other mobile and social technologies provide the home they need from which to develop self and community.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The primary program area of REACH LA is to serve LGBTQ youth who are at high risk for HIV infection with prevention and testing services.&nbsp; This is a tough group to organize and keep tabs on, as most have unstable living situations including short-term rentals, couch hopping, or homelessness. Growing up gay or transgender in an unsupportive family home can subject youth to physical and verbal abuse and/or lead to them being kicked out of the home or running away. For these youth the stress of finding a safe place to live in Los Angeles has been exacerbated by the closing of GLASS (Gay and Lesbian Adolescent Social Services) in 2008, that provided the only group home for LGBT foster youth, and by recent budget cuts to social service and nonprofit providers that work with these populations. For most of these youth, pulling together first and last month rent plus deposit is an insurmountable obstacle to obtaining stable housing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Less financially daunting and considered <strong><em>the must have</em></strong> accessory for any youth today is the cell phone, sidekick, or smart phone.&nbsp; These devices essentially become &ldquo;home-base&rdquo; for at-risk youth and a means by which services providers can keep in touch with this hard to track population.&nbsp; I know many youth that can&rsquo;t afford to keep a roof over their head, but will pay for a smart phone since this &nbsp;is their way of staying connected to the world.&nbsp; Phones can be used to look for jobs, search for apartments, meet up with friends, and update their Facebook or Myspace status.&nbsp; For service providers, mobile access is essential for keeping in touch with these youth to make sure they get follow-up counseling, get to medical appointments, and just to check-in to see how a client is doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Many agencies including REACH LA use text messaging lists as the most inexpensive and effective way to reach this population for outreach events and service updates.&nbsp; &nbsp;REACH LA also uses mobile phone service as a way for youth clients to check whether HIV confidential testing is available at any given day/time.&nbsp; The phone serves as a very discreet and intimate means to get information about HIV prevention and/or testing status.&nbsp; The combination of mobile phones and Facebook has greatly improved nonprofits abilities to stay in touch with this highly mobile group of youth.&nbsp; For example, if a client loses their phone (a common occurrence) then Facebook serves as a back-up to re-establish contact with that youth until a new phone number is set up.&nbsp; In the past this may have meant losing touch with a client for months or even years, resulting in a perilous interruption of services.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Youth are doing amazing things from their phones. One homeless youth that we worked with, who is now residing in Atlanta, keeps us updated with his news and writings by blogging from his phone and serves as an inspiration for other youth.&nbsp; Another youth, responding to a dearth of housing for LGBT street youth in Los Angeles, organized a series of hostel style apartments in Hollywood where youth could pay for a week at a time to have a bunkbed space in a shared living arrangement (http://www.thehollywooddorms.com/).&nbsp; He used his sidekick phone to remotely arrange meetings, conduct interviews, check on the security system and even open and close the apartment doors for clients.&nbsp; This is a youth that came up through the foster system and did not attend high school.&nbsp; His tech and organizing savvy comes from years of promoting large safe party events for LGBT youth by using phone line recordings and mass text messaging connected to a Myspace page (http://myspace.com/prettyboyempire).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	LGBT youth need ways to meet other youth, to find information about LGBT services, social and cultural events&hellip;more so than do other youth. They need devices to connect them to the world, so they can understand that the feelings that they have today have been shared by many that have walked before them. Probably the most critical service that a mobile device can provide is a feeling of being connected when it is needed the most.&nbsp; When your situation is dire and you are sleeping alone in a park, or at the beach, or even in a hostile home environment, the phone can literally be lifesaver connecting LGBT youth to a suicide hotline, shelter, police, or just a comforting voice of a mentor or friend.</p>

	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The public focus on social media and the Egyptian insurrection has, like the display of branded graffiti on the streets of Cairo, occluded the processes that produced this event. The Egyptian uprising of 2011 is an historic turning point for many reasons, not least of which is the rise of a new network sovereignty among the mutants of mediated multitudes. News accounts of the Tahrir Square events focused on one major divide: sovereign power of Mubarak (depicted in the repetition of his face on street signs) vs. &lsquo;people-power&rdquo; (conveyed via images of crowds in these streets). We&rsquo;re witnessing a reconfiguration of network power, new distributed asymmetries beyond the molar cut between network (freedom) and state/institutional (power). We need to train our eyes to see the proliferation of these mutations.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the February 11 Day of Victory, Tahrir Square contained a message assembled on the street (in relief): &ldquo;We are the Men of Facebook.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this gesture, the crowds were hailed to witness the revelation of the social media plotters who became the leadership core of the Revolutionary Youth Movement.<a href=""#_edn1"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[i]</a>&nbsp; In other words, the plotters simultaneously self-revealed and made a bid to become the representatives of the protestors. State Department official-turned-Google official Jared Cohen tweeted that this was a &quot;basically leaderless&quot; movement, This is accurate insofar as no <em>visible</em> representation presented itself from the outset. But the presumption here is that the lack of visibility equals lack of existence.<a href=""#_edn2"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[ii]</a> Instead, we can say the young plotters announced themselves at the precise moment when leadership was strategically useful to come out of the shadows.<img src=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/we_are_the_men_of_facebook.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what was lurking in those shadows?&nbsp; We can startwith Jared Cohen&rsquo;svery visible Google co-worker, Wael Ghonim. &nbsp;Ghonim, after vanishing in Cairo for almost two weeks, reappeared with a teary interview on Egypt&rsquo;s DreamTV on February 7, followed by a western media blitz via CNN, 60 minutes, Time magazine and other outlets. On Tues the 8th, Time already promoted him as potentially &ldquo;the leader of the faceless group of young revolutionaries,&rdquo;Foreign Policy claimed Mubarak&rsquo;s regime &ldquo;may have just created an undisputed leader for a movement that in recent days has struggled to find its footing,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal called him a key figure who was &ldquo;adopted as symbolic leader&rdquo; by protest organizers, while CNN posed the question &ldquo;is he not inevitably the <em>spiritual</em> leader&quot;? This noopolitician<a href=""#_edn3"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[iii]</a> told Wolf Blitzer that &quot;This revolution started online,&quot; specifically that it &ldquo;started on Facebook.&rdquo; When asked about what happens after Egypt, the Google exec replied, &ldquo;Ask Facebook.&quot;&nbsp;<img src=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/wael_ghonim.thumbnail.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some reasons for Ghonim&rsquo;s deference to Facebook are obvious. During his DreamTV interview, he revealed that he was the Facebook page admin for &ldquo;We are All Khalid Said,&rdquo; a key mobilizing site for the uprising. Going by the moniker El Shaheed (The Martyr), Ghonim shrouded himself in the identity of an actual martyr (the first version of the page was &ldquo;My Name is Khalid Said&rdquo;). A lesser-known reason for Ghonim&rsquo;s praise was his access to Facebook security admins. When his first page was shut down for not using a proper email, he was given a loophole to overcome the impasse by Richard Allan, Facebook&rsquo;s director of policy for Europe. Allan also noted that Facebook &ldquo;put all the key pages into special protection&rdquo; so that they would not be closed down by Mubarak&rsquo;s forces. The mysterious Ghonim admitted that he had an &ldquo;open line&rdquo; of communication with Facebook throughout the 18 days of the uprising. While many can become friends on Facebook, few can be friends <em>with</em> Facebook a la Ghonim.<a href=""#_edn4"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[iv]</a> No wonder, then, that soon after his resurfacing, a Facebook group called <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/Authorize.Ghoneim"">&#39;I delegate Wael Ghonim to speak in the name of Egypt&#39;s revolutionaries&#39;</a> emerged (prefiguring the street revelation by the RYM later that week).</p>
<p>

<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Ghonim is only one figure, one whose hypermediated visibility occludes the larger story of a complex of institutional actors involved in fomenting a social media revolution. Let&rsquo;s start by going back to Jared Cohen, our Google Ideas exec.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
	Cohen&rsquo;s last significant media appearance was in the summer of 2009. During peak moments in the June Iranian demonstrations a Twitter co-founder was emailed and asked to delay a scheduled maintenance downtime. Who made the request?&nbsp;Jared Cohen, who was then working for the State Department. His major contribution during his tenure there was as co-founder of something called the Alliance of Youth Movements (AYM).<img src=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/aoym-new-watch.thumbnail.png"" />&nbsp;Launched in 2008 with a&nbsp;summit in New York City, the AYM gathered together an ensemble of media corporations, Obama consultants, social network entrepreneurs, and youth organizations, under the auspices of the State Department. Representatives came from Old Media (MTV, NBC, CNN) and New (Google and Facebook). The AYM created an online Howcast Hub, which &ldquo;brings together youth leaders from around the world to learn, share &amp; discuss how to change the world by building powerful grassroots movements&rdquo; (Alliance of Youth Movements). Among the series of how-to videos produced for the site: How to Create a Grassroots Movement Using Social-Networking Sites, How to Smart Mob, How to Circumvent an Internet Proxy. Undersecretary James Glassman described the event as &ldquo;Public Diplomacy 2.0.&rdquo;<a href=""#_edn5"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[v]</a></p>
<p>
	<img src=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/pubdiplomacy2.0.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	Elsewhere I have called this Alliance an example of a &ldquo;Genetically Modified Grassroots Organization&rdquo; (GMGO). Neither wholly emerging from below (grassroots) nor purely invented by external forces (the astroturfing done by public relations groups), emergent groups are <em>seeded</em> (and their genetic code altered) to control the vector of the movement. These are hybrids, mutations without clear identities or immediately obvious affinities.&nbsp; They are rather movements whose potentialities are shaped by their conditions of emergence. How are we to make sense of these mutants?</p>
<p>
	We can begin with an agential cut that distributes these actors. In residual Cold-War logic, the sovereign adversaries like Iran and Egypt are said to have State-<em>run</em> mass media (which needs to be fought via social media). On the other hand, Twitter-usage in Iran as well as Facebook (and Google) in Egypt follow a certain model set out by AYM in terms of tactics and, most importantly, <em>objectives</em>. We can say that the US has State-<em>friended</em> social media. In the case of Egypt, we know that at least one of the April 6 Movement leaders attended the 2008 summit.&nbsp; Moreover, according to WikiLeaked State Department documents, another activist (name redacted) affiliated with the Egyptian revolt also participated in the conference.&nbsp; Regardless of whether this &ldquo;secret agent&rdquo; eventually reveals him/herself and the direct links to Egypt&rsquo;s RYM, we can note the importance of AYM and its tactics (as well as its co-founder).</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AYM here acts as a programmer of social media movements. It simulates grassroots by working with elements of it, replicating and disseminating tactics. In the case of Egypt, the Revolutionary Youth Movement demonstrated that (to revise the Arquilla and Ronfeldt mantra) it takes a network to fake a network. A small group embedded among the crowds, hidden at times until representation required revelation, sought to cloak itself in the martyrdom of one and the will of many. The network of emergent leadership needed to take enough credit for its organizing and mobilizing in order to claim legitimacy as representatives while simultaneously negating its actions in &ldquo;the people.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ghonim and others manage their publicity and secrecy, strategically donning online disguises while revealing themselves as the faces behind the facebook group. In their final act they transform themselves from technocratic tricksters into &ldquo;youth.&rdquo;<a href=""#_edn6"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[vi]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emergent leadership is a logical outcome of a statecraft that for over a decade devoted itself to netwar.&nbsp; Rand Corporation studies of leaderless resistance focused on both state and non-state actors.The Egyptian hybrid is of non-state actor and <em>future</em> state actor, of the <em>not-yet</em> state actors. Yet not too far away are state (department) actors as well as the state-friended media actors comprising the milieu out of which a specific network individuates itself.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The preface to another Rand collection edited by Arquilla and Ronfeldt gives us a way of conceptualizing this individuation. Alvin &amp; Heidi Toffler (1997) introduce the notion of a &ldquo;deep coalition&rdquo; comprised of a variety of state and nonstate actors in a multidimensional and nonequilibrial alliance. Tiziana Terranova understands this deep coalition as a <em>dispositif</em> within information warfare, &ldquo;a model whereby some parts of the media system no longer function as passive outlets for government propaganda but become instead active and equal members of a network of alliance (or deep coalition) that connects heterogeneous partners bound by a temporary commitment to a specific project of warfare&rdquo; (Terranova 2007 132).</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the recent cases of &ldquo;social media revolution,&rdquo; this dispositif encompasses the AYM, but would also include such Federal agencies as the Defense Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors that have been funding technology firms (e.g. the Tor Project and UltraReach) that provide institutional-technical fixes to users who need to work around State-run blockages and surveillance. The State Department, perhaps following up on the success of AYM, is gearing up to spend approximately $30 million on technology companies and human rights groups to help and train people to avoid online detection and break through firewalls.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, Egypt&rsquo;s revolt was not leaderless, but contained a hidden emergent leadership whose milieu (unstable and temporary though it was) warrants scrutiny. It means examining <em>initial conditions</em>: the code that unleashes and controls the directions of probable emergences (and even their subsequent selection). Leadership here did not naturally arise from grassroots spontaneous popular will.&nbsp; An individuated network helped set the initial conditions, disappeared within them temporarily, and then made itself known when the time was right. In other words, we witnessed an occult leadership arise based on the skillful use of anonymity and revelation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The GMGO is a genetic principle that immerses without becoming immanent, a mix of unpredictable elements and shaping factors that seek to set the parameters and selections for composition and state transition. Success is not guaranteed, but the range of virtuals and their likely actualization is guided by an embedded but relatively occulted agency (or in the case of Ghonim, a spectacular secret agency).<a href=""#_edn7"" name=""_ednref"" title="""">[vii]</a>&nbsp; Ultimately then we <em>can</em> call Egypt a &lsquo;cyber-revolution&rsquo; if we keep in mind the etymological origins in the Greek <em>kyber</em>, meaning to steer or govern.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Egyptian kybernitiki (or steerers) are an example of what Galloway and Thacker note as the convergence of sovereign and network powers. Is the GMGO a case of total programming? Network sovereignty expresses new modes of control, but doesn&rsquo;t exhaust the topology of power. The mutant network sovereigns also set the conditions for new forms of antagonism.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GMGO network sovereignty is predicated on asymmetries. For one thing, we have to ask, &ldquo;who is able to set initial conditions?&rdquo; Who has the resources and capacities to form such deep coalitions?&nbsp; The hybrids of state and nonstate actors convened by the State Department at the AYM, along with the decentralized flows of tech and financial support produce an <em>accumulation</em> of mechanisms.&nbsp; At the same time, an accumulation of this sort does not exist in isolation&mdash;it delineates an antagonism. Network sovereignty, it turns out, individuates itself via the classic distinction between friend and enemy. State-friended media can thrive only upon the repression and dissuasion of other individuations of social media usage. The determination of friendliness immediately encounters a peer hybrid, a &ldquo;State-enemied&rdquo; media usage.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take, for instance, the well-worn story about despotic attempts at blocking or criminalizing net usage. Part of Mubarak&rsquo;s sovereign abuse (or &ldquo;stupidity&rdquo; as Ghonim called it) was to try and stop social media access. Meanwhile, Barack Obama and Congress have been working on a controversial bill that would allow US government takeover of privately owned computer systems under a declared &quot;national cyberemergency,&quot; (one not to be reviewed by courts).</p>
<p>
	How would these takeovers be determined?&nbsp; Maybe we should ask Eliot Madison, part of the Tin Can Comms Collective during the 2009 G20 protests in Pittsburgh, PA. His use of Twitter during the demos (which was tame in comparison with AYM&rsquo;s own How-To videos) resulted in his being charged with &ldquo;criminal use of a communication facility, hindering apprehension or prosecution, and possession of instruments of crime.&rdquo; Or ask members of Anonymous, who were arrested on warrants issued <em>at the same time</em> our collective gaze was on Tahrir Square crowds and Ghonim&rsquo;s noopolitics.</p>
<p>
	The context defining State-enemied media usage is of course a Terror-War discourse. Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Alicalled the activists in his country &ldquo;terrorists,&rdquo; while pundits in the US routinely use the terrorism designation for Anonymous and Julian Assange. More officially, Pentagon personnel refer to domestic dissent as &ldquo;low-level terrorist activity.&rdquo; And recent raids on antiwar activists in Minneapolis were, according to the FBI, carried out to root out &quot;activities concerning the material support of terrorism.&rdquo; The FBI&rsquo;s four major categories of domestic terrorism include &ldquo;anarchist extremism,&rdquo; which encompasses anti-globalization and anti-capitalist movements (which could be said to apply to the G20 protestors such as Madison).</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Network sovereignty has agendas against agency, especially that of the &ldquo;unspecified enemy.&rdquo; And this is ultimately the source of public secret asymmetries, in which the US projects its own network sovereign shadow activities out onto individual sovereigns. What happens when these shadows come back into public awareness?&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s take it straight from one of the network sovereigns within a deep coalition: Daniel B. Baer, deputy assistant secretary in the State Department, said the department is &ldquo;unequivocal in its support of a free Internet and the rights of protesters in the Middle East as well as <em>other regions where governments restrict Web use or monitor dissident movements</em> (italics added). What might Anonymous do with this opening, this exploit? Perhaps we, as Guy Debord once hoped, can make use of what is hidden from us.&nbsp; Otherwise, we might as well continue to generate content not as users, but as used.</p>

So while there is no cause-effect logic that secures an outcome, the intervention at the level of conditions sets up the likelihood of results and regular pathways. For instance, the post Day of Victory turn against protestors by the &ldquo;youth,&rdquo; the continued reliance on military power to ensure transition, the efforts to censor subsequent street signs are not just betrayals after the fact&mdash;they were likely results from the outset.</p>

	Over the last three years, Anonymous has undergone a series of transformations. Initially called into being to coordinate Internet pranking and trolling, in the winter of 2008 it also became a narrowly focused protest movement rallying against the abuses of the Church of Scientology. In September 2010 a distinct political arm also emerged under the guise of Operation Payback to protest the Motion Player Association of America (MPAA), and a few months later, like so much of the world&#39;s attention, this arm shifted its energies to Wikileaks. It was this manifestation of Anonymous that attracted so much media coverage due the spectacular waves of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks they launched in support of Wikileaks. Despite this notoriety and despite the fact that Anonymous had already coordinated protests against the Church of Scientology, commentators struggled to describe its ethics, sociology, and history using traditional analytical categories.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	This difficulty follows from the fact that Anonymous is, like its name suggests, shrouded in some degree of mystery, a form cultural obfuscation perpetuated knowingly at times as a political tactic by its it participants; it also purports to have no leaders, no hierarchical structure, nor any geographical epicenter. Indeed while there are forms of organization and cultural logics that undeniably shape its multiple expressions, it is a name that any individual or group can, in theory, take on as their own. In this capacity, Anonymous functions as what Marco Deseriis describes as an improper name: &ldquo;The adoption of the same alias by organized collectives, affinity groups, and individual authors.&rdquo;<sup><a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote1sym"" name=""sdfootnote1anc""><sup>1</sup></a> </sup>For instance, those coordinating the DDoS attacks may not be the same people who write manifestos, or launch blogs or news sites under this name; the protests in support of Wikileaks were, for the most part, unconnected to Anonymous currently protesting the abuses of the Church of Scientology, a fact overlooked by many writing on this topic.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	In the rest of the piece, my aims are modest and narrow. I will provide a brief and truncated historical description of how the multiple political operations under the banner of Anonymous came into being and then offer, in broad strokes, some of its key organizational and ethical logics. Although in no way should this be taken as comprehensive, it will, I hope clear up some of the more common misconceptions surrounding Anonymous and its operations. In so doing, we will see how part, although not all, of Anonymous has over the last three years moved from disaggregated practices rooted in the culture of trolling to a collective form of action and identification catalyzed and moved forward by a series of political interventions, from protesting Scientology to supporting the Middle Eastern protests, giving rise to new form of political subject Anonymous.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<b>Political Birth</b></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	Anonymous emerged out of an enormously popular and anonymous image board, 4chan and was primarily associated with a phenomena&mdash;trolling&mdash;known at times to unfold there. On 4chan, once a target is chosen, trolling usually takes on an unpredictable combination of the following: telephone pranking, many unpaid pizzas are sent to the target&#39; home, DDoSing, and most especially splattering personal and the most humiliating possible information all over the Internet. Since at least 2006, many such acts were called into being by &ldquo;Anonymous.&rdquo; The motivating force and consequence of many acts of trolling, including those on 4chan, are cited as the &ldquo;lulz.&rdquo; A pluralization and bastardization of laugh out loud (lol), it denotes the pleasures of trolling, but the lulz sits on a spectrum. It can also refer more generally to more lighthearted and amusing jokes, images, and pranks.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">In 2008 a now legendary wave of trolling occurred when Anonymous </font><font face=""Times"">decided to unleash their collective, unpredictable fury against the Church of Scientology. They did so after the</font><font face=""Times""> Church made a vigorous attempt to halt the circulation of an internal church <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFBZ_uAbxS0"">video</a> featuring Tom Cruise who was exuberantly praising the practices and theology of Scientology. Soon after the Church threatened publishers, such as Gawker, with legal action (citing violation of the DMCA) if they did not take down the video, Anonymous led a series of what they call &ldquo;raids&rdquo; against the Church between January 15</font><sup><font face=""Times"">th</font></sup><font face=""Times""> and January 27</font><sup><font face=""Times"">th</font></sup><font face=""Times""> 2008, accurately described by one participant as &ldquo;ultra-coordinated motherfuckary.&rdquo;</font><font face=""Times""> </font><font face=""Times"">Consistent with previous actions, Anonymous was trolling the Church of Scientology largely for the sake of the lulz, picking on a target that geeks love to hate.</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">Soon after the first waves of trolling, the course of Anonymous veered toward more traditional political territory after some participants organized a world-wide day of street protests. What led to this change and these protests? Surprisingly a set of videos were key actors in securing this change of heart. Over the course of a week in late January of 2008, a cluster of videos were made and circulated, material that led to days of debate as to the purpose and meaning of their raiding. The first and the now the most famous <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCbKv9yiLiQ"">declared war against the Church of Scientology</a>, however it was <a href=""http://encyclopediadramatica.com/I_did_it_for_the_lulz"">made just for the lulz</a>. Five days later another video appeared, this time made by a long-time critic of the Church Mark Bunker who <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW466xcM0Yk"">asked Anonymous to reconsider</a> it trollish tactics and move toward more serious and especially legal political actions. This was soon followed by a more sincere call for political action by Anonymous.</font><font face=""Times""><b> </b></font><font face=""Times"">As thousands viewed these home-made videos, they</font><font face=""Times""><b> </b></font><font face=""Times"">worked to </font><font face=""Times"">catalyze a period of heated debate on IRC channels and one of the questions repeatedly posed was whether Anonymous should leave the Internet to protest the Church.</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">Enough participants decided to move forward with organizing a day of action. On February 10, 2008 over six thousand people protested across the United States, Canada, Europe, New Zealand, and Australia, many in front of Scientology Churches. These actions were impressive for their high levels of attendance and aesthetic bravado, which included a performance of their anonymity. Most protesters arrived wearing Guy Fawkes masks, now a staple part of Anonymous&#39; iconography.</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">What was noteworthy about these protests is how they were populated by sizable </font><font face=""Times"">chunk of protesters who lacked what we commonly associate with street protests: political intentionality and consciousness. It was a carnivalesque scene straight out of a geeky and at times offensive, but also quite playful bunker of Internet culture. People were making fun of the Church and speaking in hyper-charged Internet jargon about <a href=""http://www.lolcats.com/"">lol cats</a>, <a href=""http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Long_cat"">long cats</a>, the lulz, <a href=""http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Mudkip"">mudkips</a> and so on. </font><font face=""Times""> </font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">Soon after this global day of protests, a separation of peoples occurred, many participants receding back to the Internet from whence they came. Those that remained continue into the present to organize more traditional protests focused on human rights abuses of the church and now don a more recognizable political subjectivity. &ldquo;I came for the lulz but stayed for the outrage,&rdquo; as one Irish Anonymous participant told me in August, a sentiment expressed by many. The lulz, however, did not simply evaporate.</font><font face=""Times""><font size=""3""> Protesters engage in a difficult juggling act between traditional street protest and the more wild, grotesque, humorous, and offensive elements that are part and parcel of the lulz. </font></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">Starting in the winter of 2008 and continuing on through the fall of 2010, the more traditional political face of Anonymous was largely, although not exclusively, stitched to lambasting the abuses of the Church of Scientology.</font><sup><font face=""Times""><a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote2sym"" name=""sdfootnote2anc""><sup>2</sup></a></font></sup><font face=""Times""> In September 2010 the name Anonymous was yet again mobilized on 4chan to launch a new operation: Operation Payback. Coming in the form of politically motivated DDoS attacks, Anonymous targeted the MPAA (<a href=""http://www.myce.com/news/anonymous-operation-payback-timeline-infographic-36481/"">and eventually other organizations and companies</a>) to show support for the famous file-sharing site, the<a href=""http://thepiratebay.org/""> Pirate Bay</a> soon after their servers were DdoSed by an Indian software firm that had been hired by the MPAA to engage in this form of digital privateering.</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">The operation was first concocted on 4chan but inevitably left and partially moved to IRC because coordinating on an anonymous image board is not exactly practical. This operation was sociologically unconnected to the protests against the Church of Scientology as it was largely a different group of people initiating the actions, although some crossed over, and it was organized on different Internet Relay Chat networks as well. </font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">In December 2010 soon after Wikileaks released a small trove of diplomatic cables, those participating in Operation Payback shifted their energies to engage in the largest and most spectacular set of actions to date. Anonymous did not protest simply to register its support of Wikileaks; they launched into actions due to the fact that PayPal, Mastercard, and Amazon decided to pull all support and services for Wikileaks despite the fact that the organization had not even been charged with any infraction, much less proven guilty of anything.</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">This operation, which disabled the websites of some of the world&rsquo;s most powerful corporations for a few days, was in many ways exceptional. Due to the large infantry of geeks that logged on to IRC to watch or lend a helping hand&mdash;at one point there were over seven thousand people on the main IRC channel&mdash;this operation led to one of the most populated channels in the history of Internet Relay Chat. Despite the chaotic feel to the interaction due to these numbers, they managed to control the DDoS with a notable degree of deliberation and care. For instance, participants chose targets through polling, they collectively wrote documents to explain who and who not to attack, and constantly reminded participants of this on IRC.</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times""><b>Image</b></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">Not all participants took part in these tactics. Others took it upon themselves to make and release dozens of images and videos. In this period those protesting the Church continued to do so, some of them lending a helping hand within this node of Anonymous, many were just watching to see what would happen, and others, like a number of geeks and hackers, were ethically appraising the use of DDoS as a tactic for protest and dissent.</font><sup><font face=""Times""><a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote3sym"" name=""sdfootnote3anc""><sup>3</sup></a></font></sup></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">Soon after these attacks died down, Anonymous lent a helping hand in what seemed to be an unlikely place: Tunisia, and did so well before the North American and European media even started to report on it, at least with any depth and accuracy. On January 2, 2001 they initiated &ldquo;OpTunisia&rdquo; after the government blocked Wikileaks from the Internet and they continued to offer aid as street protests swept the country. In keeping with tradition, they DDoSed government and tourist websites but also funneled</font><font face=""Times""> out of Tunisia of the street violence and created packets for Tunisian cyberactivists and protesters providing information for evading governmental surveillance. In their care packet, some of them also gestured toward the very limits of their own cyberacitivism by stating &ldquo;This is *your* revolution. It will neither be Twittered nor televised or IRC&#39;ed. You *must* hit the streets or you *will* loose the fight. Always stay safe, once you got [sic] arrested you cannot do anything for yourself or your people. Your government *is* watching you.&rdquo;</font><sup><font face=""Times""><a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote4sym"" name=""sdfootnote4anc""><sup>4</sup></a></font></sup><font face=""Times""> </font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">OpTunisia, in many respects, represented another turning point in the political formation of Anonymous as a protest movement. Whereas most previous operations resided in the realm of Internet politics or censorship, this operation moved more squarely into human rights activism as it converged with an existing movement and attracted a large number of participants. Since this period Anonymous has continued to initiate a diverse range of operations. As Tunisia helped spark the astounding protests in Egypt, attention moved there. Along with operations in Libya and New Zealand and many other places, they have also led attacks in Italy as Silvio Berlusconi faced accusations of sleeping with a minor and in Wisconsin to protest the law that seeks to shred collective bargaining rights for public unions. Just this week they aggressively targeted Sony as a response to the lawsuits this corporate giant has issued against two gamer-hackers who have bypassed the digital protections on the PlayStation 3.</font></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">Now that we have a basic historical picture in place, I want to turn to the following questions centered on its social organization and behavioral norms: who</font> participates in Anonymous? What connects the different faces? Where and how does authority lie, pool, and disperse?</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	Technically Anonymous is open to all and it exhibits a significant degree of participatory openness. However there are forms of tacit and explicit knowledge, skills, sympathies, and know-how that lead some people and not others to politically engage in this domain. But in contrast to some organizations, including Wikileaks, it is easier to contribute to Anonymous as it offers, among other possibilities, micro-protest opportunities coordinated at the drop of a hat with no formal barriers to entry, although it helps to have some technical skills.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	A small cadre of participants in Anonymous are <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/09/the-anthropology-of-hackers/63308/"">hackers</a>:<font face=""Times""> these are skilled programmers and system administrators who identify as such and many, although not all, are motivated by some version of information freedom. A much larger group I would describe not as hackers, but instead provisionally and with qualifications, as &ldquo;geeks.&rdquo; These geek participants hold a number of digital media literacies such as video editing, design skills, and enough technical know-how to be able to use Internet Relay Chat, collaborative writing tools, and hold ethical sympathies, such as commitments to freedom of information, that make Anonymous politically attractive in the first place. Other participants may not qualify as either nor identify as geeks but over time by participating in this digital domain, they too start to learn some of the basic forms of digital literacies that might perhaps may make them, over time, into geeks</font><sup><font face=""Times""><a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote5sym"" name=""sdfootnote5anc""></a></font></sup></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">To grasp some of the power dynamics at play in Anonymous, it is imperative to address the technical architecture where many spend a significant time chatting and coordinating action: IRC. </font>It is worth restating there are currently two distinct and unconnected IRC networks where participants coordinate different efforts: Anonet and Anonops. These are, so contrary to a number of media reports, open to the public; it is just that a good deal of the public has no idea how to find or use Internet Relay Chat. One arm of Anonymous even provides a <a href=""http://irc.lc/AnonOps/lounge/WebAnon@@@@"">link to their server</a> on their website.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	Within each IRC network there are also dozens upon dozens of channels, although there are usually only a dozen that are well populated at one time. There are some channels that are devoted to social topics and lighthearted and humorous (re: lulzy) banter as the lulz is still valued among many participants. The lulz provides &ldquo;a release valve,&rdquo; as one participant explained, a valve that makes the hard and sometimes depressing work of political engagement more bearable. Other channels exist to address technical issues, and of course, there are also multiple channels where the many political operations are coordinated; some participants have a pivotal role to play in many of them, others are only involved in a few channels.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	On IRC there is a class of participants who hold more authority: those vested with infrastructural power: the IRC operators (&ldquo;ops&rdquo; are common to all IRC networks not only those of Anonymous). Tasked with maintaining order, they have the power to kick and ban individuals from the IRC network, which they will do for various reasons, including violating network and cultural norms, such as constantly connecting and disconnecting or in the case of Anonops, targeting the media or promoting violence. The are not only a handful of ops. There are dozens of them. To be an op you also don&#39;t have to be technically skilled. Ops become so by putting in work and as a result do carry more authority. Although their opinions carry more weight during the many debates that unfold on these networks, they do not determine the course of every action or operation within Anonymous.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	Authority and order are also embodied in policy, ethical sensibilities, and norms that develop over time and often are in reaction to historical events. Participants across both networks are oriented towards issues of censorship, information freedom, and as their very name signals, they tend to be overwhelmingly committed to the long-standing liberal idea&nbsp; that <a href=""https://www.eff.org/issues/anonymity"">anonymous speech</a> is necessary for a functioning and healthy democratic society. In the case of Anonops there is now an established policy to refrain attacking the media, even in countries where the media is known to be a corrupt arm of state power, as in Iran. This provision is not universally accepted and there have been periods when some participants have violated this norm, leading to what is common to any political protest movement: debate and disagreement.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	Finally to understand the dynamics of power and authority in Anonymous one must confront what is one of the most interesting, prevalent, and socially-alive norms within Anonymous: its anti-leader and anti-celebrity ethic&mdash;an ethic that modulates, even if it does not fully eliminate, the concentration of power. <font face=""Times"">Anonymous provides what Mike Wesch had described as &ldquo;a scathing critique of the postmodern cult of celebrity, individualism, and identity while serving itself as the inverted alternative.&rdquo;<a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote6sym"" name=""sdfootnote6anc""><sup>6</sup></a> It is key to note that participants don&#39;t only wax philosophical about this commitment; they enact it. Participants remind each other with remarkable frequency that one should not behave like a leader, nor seek personal attention in the media, called &ldquo;name fagging&rdquo; or &ldquo;leaderfagging.&rdquo;</font><sup><font face=""Times""><a class=""sdfootnoteanc"" href=""#sdfootnote7sym"" name=""sdfootnote7anc""><sup>7</sup></a></font></sup><font face=""Times""> If you do, you most certainly will receive a private or public drubbing, and if you have called a lot of attention to yourself, then with a mere keystroke, you might be instantly banished from IRC. </font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">I was recently witness to just this very thing after a participant had been to public about himself to a reporter, an anon who had not even put himself at risk by participating in the DDoS attacks. After reading the article where he had been featured, one Anonymous condensed the collective mood in a mere sentence: &ldquo;Attempting to use all the work that so many have done for your personal promotion is something i will not tolerate.&rdquo; Then he was killed off, exiled, as he was banished from the IRC network. </font><font face=""Times""><b> </b></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">Does the existence of this ethic mean that power never pools, that there are no forms of authority? Is Anonymous just living out a lie? No. To be sure, when it comes to certain actions, such as targeted hacking, only a small group of talented hackers can successfully pull this off. This fact, however, does not mean, as this Gawker piece <a href=""http://gawker.com/#!5783173/inside-anonymous-secret-war-room"">argued</a></font><font face=""Times""> that a small group of hackers are </font><font face=""Times""><i>the</i></font><font face=""Times""> leaders; they are confusing the power to hack, which is certainly powerful, with the power to lead all actions within Anonymous. As stated those who are more present on the network and have put in more work carry more authority. A more compelling rendition of these power dynamics would examine the dialectic between the creation of centralized power and its dispersal, which is so common to many other geeky and hacker domains of collaboration (link to two pieces). The fact that they constantly remind each othernot to behave like a leader pushes participants to strive for consensus as the preferred mode of decisions making.</font></p>
<p align=""CENTER"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times""><b>**</b></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">Due to its multifaceted, layered, and rhizomatic attributes, Anonymous, as this informative article has argued persuasively, is a challenge to study. However, is Anonymous simply, as the piece concludes: &ldquo; Cyber-lynch mobs that are organized via the Internet, who share the common meme of &ldquo;Anonymous&rdquo;, where a few people say &quot;hey let&#39;s do this&quot;, and those of like mind go do it while the others sit it out and post<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> lolcat </span></font><font face=""Times""> pictures on 4chan.&rdquo; If one spends time examining the political arms of Anonymous, it is clear that they have enough coherence, history, and ethical substance to separate them, at least in some fashion, from some other facets; even if trolling is still one of the actions coordinated under this moniker, the whole of the Anonymous cannot simply be reduced to cyber-lynching, nor can the whole of Anonymous be reduced to the forms of politics I have examined here.</font></p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">Although I have sought to contextualize Anonymous within the cultural milieu from which it arose (4chan, trolling, and the lulz), I have primarily honed in on the various political expressions of Anonymous. We can locate the political arms of Anonymous by virtue of the IRC networks they use, the regular participants who show up to contribute their time and their labor, the messages they broadcast via videos, manifestos, and messages, and the norms by which they have devised and enact. In this piece I have only scratched at the surface as to how authority, ethical and behavioral norms, and political tactics arise and function within some nodes of Anonymous.</font>&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-indent: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%;"">
	<font face=""Times"">But we can already note how Anonymous, since the winter of 2008, due to it being a very non-traditional mechanism of actions, acts as a political gateway for a great mass of geeks to take action. Anonymous provides low-barrier, flexible minimal commitment, discrete micro-protest possibilities that aren&#39;t otherwise there in a way that allow individuals to be part of something greater. You don&#39;t have to fill out a form with your personal information, you aren&#39;t being asked to send money, you don&#39;t have to even give your name... but you do feel like you are actually part of something larger. The decision to engage in political action has to happen somehow, via a concrete path of action, a set of events, or influences; Anonymous is precisely that path for many geeks.</font></p>

	<strong>Henry James on Twitter: or, the crisis in attention as production of interiority</strong></p>

<p>
	In the midst of the recent uproar over &ldquo;distracted minds&rdquo; and Twitterized attention-spans, it might be worthwhile to remember the last moment when 140-character communications became all the rage&mdash;and the response of one of our famously voluble novelists to the new technologies of distraction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	At the opening of Henry James&rsquo;s short story &ldquo;<a href=""http://www2.newpaltz.edu/~hathawar/inthcage.html"">In the Cage</a>,&rdquo; written in 1898 and revised ten years later, our heroine is in the midst of a scene we may find strangely familiar:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:27.0pt;"">
	&ldquo;It had occurred to her early that in her position-- that of a young person spending, in framed and wired confinement, the life of a guinea-pig or a magpie-- she should know a great many persons without their recognising the acquaintance. &hellip; Her function was to sit there with two young men--the other telegraphist and the counter-clerk; to mind the &quot;sounder,&quot; which was always going, to dole out stamps and postal-orders, weigh letters, answer stupid questions, give difficult change and, more than anything else, count words as numberless as the sands of the sea, the words of the telegrams thrust, from morning to night, through the gap left in the high lattice, across the encumbered shelf that her forearm ached with rubbing. &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	What James finds interesting in this scene, the source of one of his best short tales, is precisely the new varieties of <em>attention </em>that arise in the context of a new media technology: a technology paid for by the word, with a span not much longer than a tweet. &nbsp;James was fascinated by the position of the unnamed young telegraphist, who resides at the margin of the public and the private, able to covertly partake in the private dramas of telegraphs through her very public role as a part of the communication machine.&nbsp; Like the author himself, and like many bloggers and tweeters today, she is an intensely private figure given over to an immensely public occupation. Ostensibly condemned to merely count, transcribe, and monetize &ldquo;words as numberless as the sands of the sea,&rdquo; she instead acts as a covert reader, interpreter, and then actor within the private scenes limned by the terse telegraphic communications which roll across her desk: &ldquo;Everard, Hotel Brighton, Paris. Only understand and believe. 22d to 26th, and certainly 8th and 9th. Perhaps others. Come. Mary.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Innumerable jeremiads on the dangers of distraction in the age of iReading warn us of danger to human attention, as well as the values prized by the humanities, in the move to ever more novel forms of media and mediated attention.&nbsp; James&rsquo;s more than century-old treatment of the young telegraphist of &ldquo;In the Cage,&rdquo; and her resourcefulness in the face of constant and interminable distraction, should remind today&rsquo;s teachers and writers of the lingering forms of <em>attentiveness</em> that (still) matter during moments of changing technologies of attention and distraction, calling us to reconsider our own attitudes towards &ldquo;disruptive&rdquo; social technology.</p>
<p>
	1. First, disruptive stimuli can paradoxically cultivate the ability to select and to sympathize.&nbsp; What James Gleick recently called the &ldquo;Information Flood&rdquo; has its most important predecessors in the experience of the great metropoles, particularly what Georg Simmel analyzed as the effect of constant stimuli on metropolitan mental life.&nbsp; In Simmel&rsquo;s description, the individual&rsquo;s experience of the metropolitan world becomes dampened and &ldquo;habituated&rdquo; to constant change&mdash;<em>blas&eacute;, </em>to use his key term&mdash;while the inner life and its expression becomes paradoxically heightened: &ldquo;&hellip;in order that this most personal element be saved, extremities and peculiarities and individualizations must be produced and they must be over-exaggerated merely to be brought into the awareness even of the individual himself.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref"" title="""">[1]</a> James describes the effect of the information flood on his young heroine in terms remarkably similar to Simmel&rsquo;s essay of 1903: &ldquo;The girl was <em>blas&eacute;e; </em>nothing could belong more, as she perfectly knew, to the intense publicity of her profession; but she had a whimsical mind and wonderful nerves; she was subject, in short, to sudden flickers of antipathy and sympathy, red gleams in the grey, fitful needs to notice and to &lsquo;care,&rsquo; odd caprices of curiosity&rdquo; (&ldquo;New York Edition,&rdquo; 1908, vol.11: 371).&nbsp; Despite research showing a decline in empathy among some heavy users of social media, and despite worries over our <em>blas&eacute;</em> students, we should be reminded here of the selectivity of attention that most users of such media exhibit: constant stimuli can make one paradoxically more attentive to the &ldquo;signals&rdquo; that actually matter.</p>
<p>
	2. But what <em>matters </em>to the protagonist of James&rsquo;s story?&nbsp; Social standing, romance, and class, as it turns out in the course of the narrative, perhaps not quite in that order.&nbsp; The telegrams give her, in careless splashes of &ldquo;shillings and pence&rdquo; that would have fed her family for a week, a vision of the &ldquo;high reality&rdquo; of the gentleman and ladies of a London society closed to her&mdash;except, however, for the crucial fact of her own imaginative capacity.&nbsp; With that and the aid of her ha&rsquo;penny novels, she can recreate all the romances, the happinesses, and the tragedies of the upper classes&mdash;and forget the mundane fact of her own encroaching marriage to &ldquo;Mr. Mudge,&rdquo; the grocer.&nbsp; We can clearly see here an antecedent to such media as the Twitter celebrity feed or the tabloid weekly; we should note, however, that the relationship of the young girl to the imagined &ldquo;high reality&rdquo; she imagines for &ldquo;Mary&rdquo; and Captain Everard remains ambivalent&mdash;at times disgusted and at times enthralled&mdash;delighting in their tragedies as well as their romances.&nbsp; Her relationship to what she takes as a &ldquo;high reality&rdquo; is considerably more complex than that of simple ideological delusion.&nbsp; &nbsp;As the Charlie Sheen #Winning affair shows, this mix of fascination, <em>Schadenfreude</em>, and strategic aversion lies close at hand in our contemporary obsessions with &ldquo;society life&rdquo; and its perils.</p>
<p>
	3. Finally and crucially, the young telegraphist becomes an agent in the story she tracks. &nbsp;Through careful reading, small clues, and a quick intervention, she comes to play a role in the romance between &ldquo;Mary&rdquo; and Captain Everard, one where she feels herself to be briefly the equal of her &ldquo;customers,&rdquo; even perhaps holding their fate in her hands.&nbsp; The movement between an imagined vision of their &ldquo;society life&rdquo; elsewhere and the narrative of her own inner life coincide, at least for a moment.&nbsp; As with our own disruptive social technologies, the telegraph finally becomes an instrument for self-invention, opening entirely new&nbsp;areas of action and expression.&nbsp; As James also shows us, the intervention is only for a moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end the telegraphist returns to her class location, and her planned marriage to a grocer, entirely of her own will: economic determinations remain determinative.&nbsp; The difference to her inner life, however, as James uses his most painstaking techniques to show us, remains incalculable.</p>
<p>
	As we conclude this cluster on the &ldquo;Distraction Span&rdquo; in the new everyday, James&rsquo;s analog fable offers us a still point of rest, where we might take the measure of our students&rsquo; and our own digital distraction.&nbsp; Are we imaginatively and pedagogically enabled by new technological distractions, given the tools to connect across continents and class lines (in both senses), enabled to form new imagined communities and perhaps renewed inner lives, as @Asher Danziger and @Lauren Berliner seem to suggest?&nbsp; Indeed, as @Gina Lamb demonstrates, social media tools could save the inner lives <em>and </em>physical lives of those subsisting on the fringes of the &ldquo;everyday,&rdquo; like the dangerously exposed LGBT youth she describes. &nbsp;In the majority case, however, we still must ask: are we and our students fated to return from our dalliances with the virtual, like the young telegraphist of James&rsquo;s story, to Mr. Mudge the grocer and economic necessity, and to the &ldquo;framed and wired confinement&rdquo; of a digital life &ldquo;in the cage,&rdquo; attenuated and numbed by constant distraction?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	@Elizabeth Losh&rsquo;s fascinating entries on an experiment with Twitter in the lecture classroom, along with @Quinlan Adley&rsquo;s bleak view of Facebook pathology, reminds us of the dangers as well as the possibilities of social media in educational contexts, and raises some disturbing questions about the potential for new media to obscure communicative context and empathetic response.&nbsp; @Sara Harris, along with Losh and @Tara Zepel, addresses what seems to me the crucial question of the teacher&rsquo;s role in modeling and focusing attention in any context, analog or digital, as does their students&rsquo; central question: &ldquo;what is the assignment?&rdquo;&nbsp; The problem with being &ldquo;one of those people on whom nothing is lost,&rdquo; as Henry James described his own writerly state of distraction, is that one must then also have a sense of what matters, and why.&nbsp; Attentive pedagogy in the new media landscape, then, cannot do without a concept of the good life, of worthwhile political goals, of the final ends of education for the individual and the community, and of necessary critical analysis, even as we remain attentive to the generation of new forms of communal and inner life in a new age of distraction.</p>

Why does the &ldquo;media spotlight&rdquo; paradigm continue to hold sway in a journalistic world so radically different than the one Gitlin chronicled in the 1980&rsquo;s? After all, Wikileaks is itself a media organization; why should it be so dependent on the celebrity-inclined tendencies of the traditional press?

While much of the analysis of the continued importance of the traditional press is often framed in terms of&nbsp;the fact that it contributes the most original reporting and shoe-leather journalism, we shouldn&rsquo;t forget that there are other reasons for the success of the mainstream media as well. One of them is the manner in which it taps into a deep desire on the part of news consumers to be entertained, to bask in the sun of celebrity. It may be that the &ldquo;scientific journalism&rdquo; of Wikileaks and similar groups is too bloodless to ever obviate the need for the creation of dramatic stories with outsized personalities and colorful characters.</font></span></p>

The University Auxiliary Service Corporation can also be understood as an institution established to function partly outside of the public and to be more flexible for market engagement thus helping to facilitate the privatization of the public. I plan to explore the implications of this restructuring by looking at how UAS has historically engaged with the unionization efforts of campus food service workers. Attention to the relationship between institutions (public and private) and labor will guide my examination of how the University Auxiliary Service Corporation (a quasi-state organization) and subcontracted food service corporations interact with campus food service workers. UAS has occupied a spectrum of positions vis-&agrave;-vis workers and private interests, but consistently attempts to locate workers outside the University.</p>

	Aihwa Ong defines neoliberalism as &ldquo;mobile calculative techniques of governing that can be decontextualized from their original sources and recontextualized in constellations of mutually constitutive and contingent relationships.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""">[4]</a> Ong&rsquo;s definition of neoliberalism allows for a localized analysis of a global trend because it frames neoliberalism as a set of techniques linked to new modes of governmentality, not a specific culture or structure that is easily definable or homogenously applied across various geographies. Ong also draws attention to the relationship between neoliberalism and exception arguing that exceptions to neoliberal techniques can be employed to both include and exclude specific peoples. She uses migrant workers, refugees, and trafficked peoples as an example of excluded populations who are denied citizenship or other rights. She argues that, &ldquo;in these situations of humanitarian crisis, legal citizenship is merely one of multiple schemes for (re)ordering and (re)evaluating humanity.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title="""">[5]</a> In a U.S. context, citizenship is one mechanism through which exclusion of specific populations takes place.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Within the U.S., food supply and food service work is dominated by immigrant labor. About 60% of farmworkers in the United States are undocumented or about 6 in 10.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"" title="""">[6]</a>&nbsp; Although technically contracted work, the contracts farmworkers engage in tend to be highly exploitative. In a report compiled by the <em>Southern Poverty Law Center</em>, one Latino immigrant working on a tomato farm in Florida reported making 45 cents per 32-pound bucket of tomatoes with no sick or vacation days, no health insurance, and daily exposure to pesticides. Inherent in the various forms of contractual exclusion (i.e. subcontracting agreements, flexible labor positions, piece work, or under the table work) is a fundamental devaluing of labor. Frequently, subcategories of &lsquo;official&rsquo; labor positions are created to skirt state or federal labor laws. Underlying the contractual exclusion of immigrant workers is an unwillingness to recognize individuals as full citizens subject to all the rights and entitlements of citizenship.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	As of November 2010, there were 443 food service workers at University at Albany.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"" title="""">[7]</a> Overall, there are 295 union workers, 100 student workers, and 48 managers.

The exclusion of campus food service workers from official recognition denies them access to University boards, councils, and committees.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

	While there are notable risks in making the comparison between citizenship of a nation-state and membership to a campus community, there are logical parallels that can be drawn between global and national trends that have attempted to locate certain groups of laborers outside the nation-state by excluding them from citizenship rights and a trend at the University at Albany to locate campus food service workers outside the University by excluding them from the campus workforce. It is beyond the scope of this paper to explore the historical roots of nation-state formation or conceptions of citizenship, but common in both locations is the fact that specific types of membership have undergone significant transformations under neoliberal capitalism. Also, that these transformations have included a reordering of rights and entitlements in order to extract cheaper labor from vulnerable workers.</p>

	<em>I. Campus Food Service Workers under the Faculty Student Association (FSA) and University Auxiliary Services (UAS) Management</em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Auxiliary service corporations exist at a number of colleges and universities SUNY-wide. There is a SUNY Auxiliary Services Association (SASA) that meets annually and includes members from over 30 campuses, as well as members from the Research Foundation and Systems Administration. The SASA website gives a brief history of the rise of auxiliary service corporations (ASCs) within SUNY, stating that State University campuses began chartering non-profit corporations in the 1950s to administer campus activities and:</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	to further insulate NYS from services with high liability exposure and because NYS agency requirements and systems for accounting, reporting, and budgeting can not effectively accommodate retail and consumer service enterprises.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn11"" name=""_ftnref11"" title="""">[11]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	There are three main purposes for the establishment of ASCs; to protect SUNY campuses from liability issues, to provide SUNY with agencies that can more actively engage with private capital, and to take advantage of tax breaks and public funding available to corporations in New York State through Industrial Development Agency (IDA) financing.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Prior to ASCs, many campuses had Faculty Student Associations (FSA), including University at Albany. It is unclear when FSA began, but it switched from FSA to UAS over the summer of 1976. About a year prior to the transition, University at Albany students had voted themselves as a majority on two of the FSA boards. As an <em>Albany Student Press</em> article recounts, &ldquo;besides a basic yearning of the students involved to achieve a greater voice in FSA, what helped to bring about the dramatic actions of the day was the inopportune absence of a faculty member.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn12"" name=""_ftnref12"" title="""">[12]</a> Student members of FSA, realizing they had a voting majority, restructured the bylaws to allow for a student majority on the FSA membership board and the FSA board of directors. Shorty afterwards, students mobilized to vote in a student FSA President and pass a 4% rebate for students with meal plans.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn13"" name=""_ftnref13"" title="""">[13]</a> The rebate exemplified the fact that students were dissatisfied with how FSA was doing business on campus, mainly the fact that they were attempting to accrue funds for other campus activities on the backs of students and their meal plan dollars. Students argued that FSA had accumulated an excess of funds over the previous 3 years which belonged to students and therefore should be given back.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	About a year after students voted themselves as a majority in FSA, it was transformed into UAS. There is no note in the <em>Albany Student Press</em> of what motivated the change at UAlbany&rsquo;s campus; in a June 1976 article there is simply a parenthetical reference to UAS as the former FSA. Yet, SASA&rsquo;s website provides some statewide context to these changes noting that in 1967 a statewide committee was appointed by the Vice Chancellor for Business and Finance to review the scope of FSAs SUNY-wide.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn14"" name=""_ftnref14"" title="""">[14]</a> The committee recommended more standardization throughout the SUNY system and the report comments that:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	[T]he rather informal association governance style attendant to campus FSAs gradually gave way to the more structured membership corporation model we have today, collectively referred to as Auxiliary Service Corporations (ASCs).<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn15"" name=""_ftnref15"" title="""">[15]</a></p>
<p>
	<br />
	While not explicitly stated, an &ldquo;informal association governance style&rdquo; could read as a governance style more susceptible to student control or open to democratic processes in locations where students or other members of the community were able to gain active control of FSA boards. Either way, the shift from FSA to UAS resulted in a more corporatized structure that would make it impossible, in its contemporary form, for UAlbany students to gain majority control over a UAS board ever again.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn16"" name=""_ftnref16"" title="""">[16]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	There are conflicting records on the date University Auxiliary Services was established, the <em>Albany Student Press </em>starts mentioning its existence in June 1976, but the UAS office dates its establishment to 1950.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn17"" name=""_ftnref17"" title="""">[17]</a> The shift from FSA to UAS marked a change in the governance structure of campus service management that began to move its operations further away from the logics of public governance. For example, the governance bodies of public institutions are subject to Freedom of Information Law requests and Open Meetings Law yet there has been contestation over whether ASCs in SUNY are subject to those laws. The main point of contention is whether or not ASCs are &ldquo;public bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The NYS Committee on Open Government has issued three opinions on auxiliary corporations within SUNY commenting on the confusing nature of auxiliary corporations and their relationship to the state. In 1993, the United Industry Workers Local 424 requested SUNY Farmingdale&rsquo;s Request for Proposal (RFP) for food service and the contract between SUNY Farmingdale and Bon App&eacute;tit Management and was denied.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn18"" name=""_ftnref18"" title="""">[18]</a> The union representative was requesting the information because of concerns that, &ldquo;[SUNY Farmingdale] &lsquo;through its &lsquo;Auxiliary Service Corporation&rsquo; has contracted with Bon Appetit Management of California&rsquo;, and that a number of employees &lsquo;may face job loss and health care loss due to the contractor&#39;s position.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn19"" name=""_ftnref19"" title="""">[19]</a> Robert Freeman, Director of the Committee on Open Government, commented that:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	If the Auxiliary Services Corporation exists due to its relationship with SUNY College at Farmingdale, and if the College would perform the functions of the Corporation if the Corporation had not been created, it might be concluded that such an entity conducts public business and performs a governmental function for the University.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn20"" name=""_ftnref20"" title="""">[20]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Freeman is challenging ASCs position as an agency wholly separate from a public institution by asserting that since it carries out the functions of a public institution it should be subject to the same rules and regulations.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The issue of ASCs status as a public or non-public agency was brought to the attention of the Committee on Open Government again in 1998 and 2001. In 2001, a University at Albany student requested an opinion from the Committee on Open Government because the student had been asked to leave a UAS meeting prior to the approval of a meal plan fee hike and told by the UAS Executive Director that UAS was subject to neither Open Meetings Law nor FOIL requests. In response, Director Robert Freeman argued that:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	I believe that each condition necessary to a finding that the board of UAS is a &quot;public body&quot; may be met. It is an entity for which a quorum is required pursuant to the provisions of the Not-for-Profit Corporation Law. It consists of more than two members. In view of the degree of governmental control exercised by and its nexus with the University at Albany, I believe that it conducts public business and performs a governmental function for a governmental entity.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn21"" name=""_ftnref21"" title="""">[21]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Here Freeman again asserts that ASCs, despite their attempts to skirt public law, are public bodies, performing public functions. All three opinions (1993, 1998, and 2001) occur around the time when ASCs began contracting more heavily with outside corporate vendors and two pertain, either directly or tangentially, to UAS&rsquo; relationship with a contractor.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<em>II. UAS Subcontracts Food Service to Sodexho-Marriott </em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Over the past 30 years campus food services at University at Albany has been managed by three different parties. Before 1999, campus food service was managed by the Faculty Student Association (FSA) which later became University Auxiliary Services (UAS); both were considered University bodies and therefore workers were managed directly by the University. In July 1999, UAS made the decision to subcontract campus dining services to a private corporation and awarded the contract to Sodexho-Marriott who managed the food service contract until June 2000. On July 1, 2000 Chartwells, a division of the Compass Group, took over the contract and currently manages food service at University at Albany.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.75in;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In the Spring of 1999, Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees (HERE) organized a union drive among campus food service workers at the University at Albany, SUNY.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn22"" name=""_ftnref22"" title="""">[22]</a> After 70% of the workers signed cards expressing their desire to have a union, the cards were delivered to University Auxiliary Services (UAS). In June of 1999, UAS agreed to recognize the union, yet less than a month later they contracted out to the Sodexho-Marriott Corporation who took over the food service contract on July 1, 1999.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn23"" name=""_ftnref23"" title="""">[23]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Under Sodexho-Marriott working conditions worsened and the companyrefused to recognize the union. As Larry Wittner explains:</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	The company stripped workers of hundreds of hours of accumulated sick time and, also, quadruped their health insurance premiums.&nbsp; As workers were paid only $6 to $7 an hour, many had no choice but to opt out of Sodexho-Marriott&#39;s expensive health care plan.&nbsp; Facing reduced benefits and deteriorating working conditions, the number of regular employees plummeted.&nbsp; Because of the now chronic understaffing, most workers put in 12-hour shifts.&nbsp; Workers were told that they could not discuss job conditions among themselves or with others.&nbsp; And when some dared to wear &quot;Union Yes&quot; pins, Sodexho-Marriott managers ordered them to remove these traces of resistance.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn24"" name=""_ftnref24"" title="""">[24]</a></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In response to Sodexho&rsquo;s unwillingness to recognize the union, students, faculty and community members formed the Student-Labor Initiative (SLI, pronounced &quot;sly&quot;) and began organizing actions to draw attention to Sodexho&rsquo;s anti-union practices as well as their investment in privatized prisons nationally.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn25"" name=""_ftnref25"" title="""">[25]</a> HERE, Local 471 simultaneously filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the National Labor Relations Board.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn26"" name=""_ftnref26"" title="""">[26]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Members of the campus community mounted a year-long campaign to back the campus food service workers right to unionize. In response, UAS and other University administrators attempted to avoid involvement in the labor dispute. Wittner states, &ldquo;despite these early protests, the assorted campus managers&mdash;the administration, UAS, and Sodexho-Marriott&mdash;resorted to every possible excuse to evade the issue of the mistreatment of food service workers.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn27"" name=""_ftnref27"" title="""">[27]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Despite the University and UASs assertions that an intervention was beyond their scope, campus discontent with Sodexho continued to mount and an outbreak of e-coli bacteria in the Indian Dining Hall at the end of March exacerbated dissatisfaction with the company. In April, the campaign intensified and culminated in a sit-in in the University President&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>
	Amber Martin, a student organizer, commented, &ldquo;Our message [is] loud and clear: boot Sodexho-Marriott and hold all campus contractors to basic standards of behavior towards their workers.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn28"" name=""_ftnref28"" title="""">[28]</a> Less than a month later, UAS announced its decision to end the contract with Sodexho-Marriott and put out a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a new food service provider. Sodexho&rsquo;s contract had only lasted for one academic year (1999-2000).</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<em>III. Chartwells, UAS, and Workers United Local 471</em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	On July 1, 2000 Chartwells, a division of the Compass Group, took over the contract and currently manages food service at University at Albany. While there may have been other worker and union struggles during Chartwells&rsquo; management, I focus on Fall 2009, when Chartwells prohibited the union representative from entering the dining halls.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn29"" name=""_ftnref29"" title="""">[29]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In September 2009, the Workers United, Local 471 union representative, Amanda Lefton investigated a number of workplace grievances including potentially hazardous working conditions, delays in holiday pay, and wage violations. In one instance, workers had to work in 110-degree conditions when two vents in the Colonial Quad dining hall broke.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn30"" name=""_ftnref30"" title="""">[30]</a> As one worker stated, &ldquo;We went two or three days in those conditions. Chartwells didn&rsquo;t help at all until the complaints got heavy.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn31"" name=""_ftnref31"" title="""">[31]</a> Shortly after Lefton began pursuing grievances and attempting to hold Chartwells to the collective bargaining agreement, she was notified that Chartwells would no longer recognize Workers United, Local 471 as the appropriate bargaining unit and therefore Lefton was not allowed on the premises. Chartwells refused to meet with Lefton, started placing union dues in escrow, advised workers not to post notices on union bulletin boards, and told workers not to speak with students about working conditions when off the clock.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn32"" name=""_ftnref32"" title="""">[32]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Chartwells justified their actions on the basis that there was a national dispute between UNITE HERE and Service Employees International Union (SEIU). According to a report sent to United University Professions (UUP):</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	Earlier this year Chartwells received competing representation claims from UNITE HERE and the Rochester Regional Joint Board (Workers United-SEIU) regarding our hourly associates at University at Albany. These competing claims are related to the disaffiliation of the Rochester Regional Joint Board (RRJB), as well as multiple other joint boards across the country, from UNITE HERE and their subsequent affiliation with SEIU.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn33"" name=""_ftnref33"" title="""">[33]</a></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<h6>
	In April 2009, Local 471 decided to disaffiliate with UNITE HERE. Although Chartwells stated the reason for denying Lefton access to the campus was due to competing representation claims, Chartwells had waited over 5 months to act. Due to the timing of Chartwells&rsquo; action, Workers United, Local 471 viewed their decision to ban Lefton from the University at Albany campus as retaliation for the filing of successful grievances stating, &ldquo;This is blatant retaliation against the workers for attempting to prevent wage violations and aggressively investigating hazardous working conditions.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn34"" name=""_ftnref34"" title="""">[34]</a> The union also asserted that workers had chosen to have Workers United, Local 471 represent them stating, &ldquo;The Union members, have voiced their choice three times to keep their Union, Workers United Local 471.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn35"" name=""_ftnref35"" title="""">[35]</a><a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn35"" name=""_ftnref35"" title=""""></a></h6>
<h6>
	&nbsp;</h6>
<h6>
	Following Lefton&rsquo;s banning from the University at Albany campus, she began to contact campus union representatives and student organizations to mobilize against Chartwells&rsquo; decision. Larry Wittner, Chair of the Albany Chapter UUP Solidarity Committee, agreed to organize a meeting with members of Local 471 to discuss Chartwells&rsquo; decision to terminate union representation. On Wednesday November 11, 2009 at 11:30am, campus food service workers and members of Workers United, Local 471, students and faculty members gathered in front of the Campus Center to protest Chartwells&rsquo; actions. A number of student speakers emphasized that the food service workers were undoubtedly a part of the UAlbany community. Bredan Anderson, UAlbany student and member of the College Democrats stated, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to stand by while some folks in our community are taken advantage of and neither should the University nor its students.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn36"" name=""_ftnref36"" title="""">[36]</a> Ben Jacobs, another UAlbany student and member of the College Democrats also emphasized the workers place in the UAlbany community stating:</h6>
<h6>
	&nbsp;</h6>
<h6>
	We&rsquo;re here to say, as students, that the Chartwells workers and the food service workers on this campus are part of our community and we will not tolerate the mistreatment of them or anyone else in our community. It is our duty and our responsibility to make sure that there is fair and equal treatment of everyone on this campus.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn37"" name=""_ftnref37"" title="""">[37]</a></h6>
<h6>
	&nbsp;</h6>
<h6>
	Those at the rally were clearly contesting the University&rsquo;s position that since food service workers were managed by Chartwells, the University had no responsibility in enforcing labor rights.</h6>
<h6>
	&nbsp;</h6>
<h6>
	After rallying in front of the Campus Center, the rally marched to the President&rsquo;s office where Rev. Mike Roberts, District Director of Workers United, Local 471 and Tracey Cobbs, Chartwells&rsquo; worker and Union leader entered the building and asked to speak with President George Philip. Roberts and Cobbs were met by Kevin Wilcox, University Controller and board member of University Auxiliary Services. Wilcox stated, &ldquo;This is not my issue. To be honest, this is not a University issue. This is an issue with Chartwells.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn38"" name=""_ftnref38"" title="""">[38]</a> Roberts responded stating,</h6>
<h6>
	&ldquo;So far, as you are, the President is trying to maintain that SUNY Albany does not have the right to insist that its vendors behave ethically.&rdquo; Wilcox later insisted again, &ldquo;Let me make something clear, they&rsquo;re not University workers.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn39"" name=""_ftnref39"" title="""">[39]</a> Wilcox then agreed to take a message for the President, but refused to be involved. Cobbs voiced her frustration with Wilcox stating:</h6>
<h6>
	&nbsp;</h6>
<h6>
	No one right now wants to take responsibility for anything. Compass [Group] just had someone come in and tell us they&rsquo;re not responsible. We&rsquo;re being told by the President they&rsquo;re not responsible. Somebody on this campus is responsible for something.<a href=""file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Jackie%20Hayes/My%20Documents/Downloads/Hayes_New%20Everyday.docx#_ftn40"" name=""_ftnref40"" title="""">[40]</a></h6>
<h6>
	&nbsp;</h6>
<h6>
	Wilcox was not interested in whether or not Chartwells was upholding basic labor standards, but based his argument in the logic that campus food service workers were not University workers and therefore the University was not responsible for the enforcement of labor rights. By framing the argument as an issue of responsibility, Wilcox discursively positioned campus food service workers as outsiders, not entitled to the same rights as other University workers or members of the campus community.</h6>
<h6>

<p>
	<em>Conclusion: Neoliberalism and the Transformation of Campus Food Service Labor and University Governance</em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Capitalism has always put considerable pressure on the University, but the particularities of restructuring under neoliberalism have significantly transformed labor relations and University governance at the University at Albany. Auxiliary Service Corporations were formed SUNY-wide beginning in the 1950s and were established to protect SUNY campuses from liability issues, to provide SUNY with agencies that could more actively engage with private capital, and to take advantage of tax breaks and public funding available to corporations in New York State. The structure of UAS allowed for the limiting of a student voice on its board and a broader limiting of public engagement with University decisions by attempts to close meetings and records to the public. Also, the UAS structure allowed for the outsourcing of campus services leading to the exclusion of campus food service workers from the campus community and a worsening of working conditions and benefits. The Board members of UAS&rsquo; have attempted to limit the space for resistance by contesting UAS&rsquo; &lsquo;public&rsquo; function, by defining campus food service workers as non-University workers, and limiting student representation on its board. If we are to build a more inclusive, democratic University the structures on campus must be transformed to cater to public engagement and the inclusion of a broader campus community which includes campus food service workers.</p>

	Anticipation of Safety</p>
<p>
	The observation I conducted in Columbia was right here at our University.&nbsp; The surveillance of Thomas Cooper Library (TCL) at the University of South Carolina was indeed substantial and impressive.&nbsp; Thomas Cooper Library is 35 years old and encompasses a space of 290,000 square feet containing 45 miles of shelves, holding 1.5 million volumes! This is no small place to survey.&nbsp; Upon my first exploration of the surveillance of TCL, I counted 26 cameras in the entire library and 14 cameras in the Ernest F. Hollings Special Collections Library.&nbsp; I had no idea that there were so many cameras watching the students, faculty, and visitors of the facility. Here is a <a href=""http://library.sc.edu/crosssection.html"">cross section</a>of the 7 floors of TCL.</p>
<p align=""center"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	For the surveillance observation of TCL, I chose to monitor two cameras located in front of the entrance.&nbsp; These are two Honeywell security cameras mounted to the sides of a column located in the lobby.&nbsp; One of the cameras views the left of the front doors and the other looks straight towards the front doors. &nbsp;I decided to observe this area because these two cameras see every person that enters and exits the library.&nbsp; In the event of any crime or misdemeanor, the footage from these cameras will be checked first.&nbsp; I was also curious to see how many people noticed the cameras upon entering the library, and if they reacted to them.&nbsp; This is a map of the main level of the library, where the two cameras that I observed are located:</p>
<p>

					<p align=""center"">
						<em>Security Cameras located here</em></p>
				</div>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	During my study of TCL on June 15, 2011, from 10:30am- 12:30pm, I noticed that almost all of the people entering the library did not even notice the camera directly in front of the door.&nbsp; Most of the people entering came in at a steady pace and knew the direction they were headed.&nbsp; Few people stood in front of the door for a couple seconds deciding where to go.&nbsp; I only noticed one person looking at the camera as they walked through the door, and two people seemed to avoid the camera as they walked through.&nbsp; The first had his face turned down and away from the camera, and the second had his head turned away from the camera and walked very quickly.&nbsp; During my observation, there was also a librarian walking around the front of the library monitoring students.&nbsp; She made her way around the perimeter of computers located in the lobby a few times and stood by the front door looking in for a couple minutes, and then disappeared back to a desk.</p>
<p>
	Making this data quantifiable added something more to my observation as well. I decided to take count of the number of people entering the library and leaving while I was there. I tallied every person who walked through the doors.&nbsp; The number of exiting peoples was easier to obtain, as there is always an employee of the library sitting by the exit with a clicker to count every person who leaves.&nbsp; So, I talked with the head of security, Tucky Taylor, and she had no problem with me obtaining that number for my observation.&nbsp; So, these are the numbers:</p>
<p>
	People Coming in the Library, 10:50am-12:30pm &ndash; 220</p>
<p>
	People Leaving, 10am- 12:30pm - 320</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My experience of observing the surveillance at TCL was interesting, because it forced me to step outside my comfort zone and question something new.&nbsp;&nbsp; While I was going around looking at all of the cameras during my first observation, I became aware of my own worry that someone was watching me.&nbsp; My hyper-awareness of being approached by faculty or security made me somewhat uncomfortable.&nbsp; By acting out of the norm and searching for surveillance, I felt that I made myself noticeable.&nbsp; By the same token, during my second day of observation I became the surveyor and caused other people to become aware of my watching them.&nbsp; While I sat by the front door, I also decided to tally the number of people that looked at me as they walked in.&nbsp; This number was nowhere near the total number of people entering, but it was interesting that so many did notice my eyes on them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	People looking at me- 43</p>
<p>
	Here Christopher Slobogin&rsquo;s notion of public anonymity is interesting to consider.&nbsp; When you walk into the library, you participate in the functioning of public anonymity unless you step outside the norm of student behavior for some reason, as I had.&nbsp; You are nameless and invisible until you behave criminally or do something out of the norm.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was no longer nameless and invisible when I approached the employee at the exit to acquire data about people leaving, or when I spoke with the head of security at the front of the library.&nbsp; My presence became known because I made myself known to the library staff.&nbsp; In a similar way, the individualizing function of discipline happens in the library as well.&nbsp; Many students come into the library to use the computers.&nbsp; We are required to type in our individual USC id number and password to log on to a computer.&nbsp; This identification number holds our personal information with the University.&nbsp; We are &ldquo;separated off&rdquo; from others by this, because the institution knows which computer we are on and likely what we are doing.</p>
<p>
	Before my observation, I talked with Tucky Taylor about the security of TCL.&nbsp; I was surprised to learn of the prevalence of theft in the library, but she explained that <strong>&ldquo;the library was the perfect place to steal from&rdquo;</strong>.&nbsp; She said this was because people come to the library over and over and they begin to feel safe there.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t think anyone would ever steal their stuff or anything could happen there.&nbsp; She described there being an <strong>&ldquo;aura of safety in the library&rdquo;</strong>.&nbsp; However, this is precisely how theft happens so often.&nbsp; Opportunity arises and people are desperate for money, so they steal.&nbsp; People run out of their loan money, can&rsquo;t afford their bills, or whatever the case may be.&nbsp; Taylor says theft is often times more opportunity crimes than pattern crimes, and they catch the guilty about half of the time.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;This opportunity theft in a realm of safety becomes interesting in light of Richard Grusin&rsquo;s notion of anticipation as a function of the logic of security.&nbsp; Grusin describes a state of anticipation of security that allows for pre-emptive measures to be taken to intervene in crime.&nbsp; Premediation is <strong>&ldquo;&hellip;the implementation of premediated algorithms of data mining and risk analysis to uncover patterns of suspicious behavior before they could be actualized&hellip;&rdquo;</strong> (Grusin 123).&nbsp; Just as in the film <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/""><em>Minority Report</em></a>, crimes could be avoided by effective pre-emption.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Premediation encourages our society to network and mobilize, and make ourselves visible and susceptible to security and the kinds of surveillance it entails in order to collect data and take pre-emptive measures to protect ourselves.</p>
<p>
	<strong>&ldquo;Our everyday transactions of mediation, transportation, and communication are encouraged for security purposes not only by making them easy and readily available but also by making them affectively pleasurable&hellip;by maintaining low levels of affective intensity that provide a kind of buffer or safe space&hellip;&rdquo;</strong>(Grusin 126).</p>
<p>
	This quote describes the &ldquo;safe&rdquo; space available for us to communicate and work through media. The library has come to be a place of safety for its&rsquo; visitors and the surveillance cameras operating there communicate safety to us.&nbsp; However, the fact of the matter is that we don&rsquo;t even recognize them anymore but we always anticipate their being there. &nbsp;Opportunities that might present themselves to potential thieves in the library are encouraged to be avoided, by signs warning students not to leave their belongings unattended. &nbsp;Students often don&rsquo;t even notice these signs. &nbsp;This is how risk management works: it relies on a tension between prevalent and anticipated existence of cameras and a lack of awareness of them.</p>

	<em>The Four Points</em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I observed the intersection of Main St. and Hampton St. in Columbia, SC on June 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup>, 2011. Beyond the obvious traffic-pedestrian-&amp; vehicular movement-I noticed four different sites of circulation.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Sites of circulation:</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Sylvan Bros. Jewelers (merchandise/commerce): circulation of good</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Wachovia Bank (business/finance): circulation of currency</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Art Museum (art/culture): circulation of knowledge/ideas</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Marriott Hotel (tourism/travel): circulation of bodies/people</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	These four sites of circulation become more interesting in light of Michel Foucault. He talks about security management and regulation. Through his insights I am able to draw the conclusion that all four areas of the intersection are all working as a network of sorts.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Surveilling circulation: the cameras</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	1. <em>Sylvan Bros</em>. &ndash; Two cameras. One at door, and one above facing the counter.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	2. <em>Wachovia </em>&ndash; Three cameras visible to everyday individual. One at the ATM outside the bank. Two inside the bank; one facing the door the other facing the line/teller area.</p>

	3. <em>Art Museum </em>&ndash; One security guard (who confronted me).</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Dog walkers: 8</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Business walkers: 39</p>

	(<em>This picture is of the Sylvan Bros. Jewelers on the corner of Main and Hampton. I studied the area for two hours surveying the area and overlooking the people as they interacted with the forms of cameras used to capture them).</em></p>
<p align=""center"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	There were nine cameras that I counted in the one block intersection, on the corners of the street. I feel that the amount of cameras in used to increase the opportunity of catching someone in the act of doing something wrong.&nbsp; This amount of camera surveillance serves to expand the panopticon theory from a small area of focus, to a much larger, more elaborate layout. Whoever is monitoring the area is in full control, with the individuals on the street completely unaware of their surveillance.</p>

<p align=""center"">
	&ldquo;The antithesis of public anonymity is the Panopticon, a model prison first imagined by Jeremy Bentham. The panopticon is a circular, with the prison cells and walkways placed around the perimeter and the guard station placed on the top of a tower in the middle, an arrangement enabling a large number of prisoners to be watched by just a few guards. In theory, every movement of every person could be monitored as such.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
	<strong>- Connections:</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the movie <em>Minority Report,</em> we see the circulation all of the above mentioned aspects of culture. We see the circulation of knowledge, goods, currency, and people all take place in the scene in which Tom Cruises&rsquo; character is walking through the mall. There is apparent cultural value shown in this scene. Just like the museum that I watched, there was a circulation of knowledge and ideas shown through the art that is displayed, in the movie, there are images all over the mall hallway. There is also a visible connection between the mall and the jewelry store that I watched. There is a circulation of goods and products in both instances. The Marriott Hotel that I surveilled is an example of a circulation of people/bodies. In <em>Minority Report</em> the movement of the people in the mall hallway qualify as a circ. of people as well. Lastly, the bank that I stationed myself at, and the use of money in the movie, connect to the circulation of currency.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the corner of Main and Hampton, I recognize that all of the different forms of surveillance seem to always be in conversation. They are all part of a network that complements one another. The cameras near the jewelers cover a little bit of the street near the hotel. The hotel has cameras facing the bank and the street. The bank&rsquo;s cameras catch not only the hotel, but the museum as well. The museum has a security guard who can see all four corners with no problem. We see in this context of intersection the ways that surveillance at each site is working together. This makes it quite manageable for the owners to help one another regulate their businesses efficiently.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>-Thoughts:</strong></p>
<p>
	Lastly, I want to raise a final question for my report: Why, once we see and recognize a camera as surveillance, do we keep looking back at it as if it has a soul? Why are we not satisfied with one initial look at the camera? Well, humans are naturally paranoid, anxious, etc. We get nervous thinking that we aren&rsquo;t the only ones that are aware of our actions, before and, or, during the actual instance of occurrence. That&rsquo;s the only answer I can think of... I for one can say that I always look at cameras over and over again as if they were a human figure. It&rsquo;s a weird condition that we are used to and accept at this point in society. Obviously the main point of any form of surveillance is safety and protection. However we pay the price of having our individual lives being invaded quite a bit in order for this to occur. The movie <em>Minority Report</em>, blows this idea out of proportion, but nails it right on the head. &ldquo;Pre-crime&rdquo; mirrors directly a very advanced, yet parallel form of surveillance to our culture today. The idea that we can stop/maintain a level of crime, if, and only if, we can somewhat &ldquo;invade&rdquo; the lives around us.</p>

	<u>I Always Feel Like Somebody&rsquo;s Watching Me</u></p>
<p>
	My observation site was located in the <a href=""http://www.vistaontheriver.com/"">Vista</a> of Columbia, SC.&nbsp; The Vista is a historic area of downtown Columbia filled with shops, restaurants, and bars.&nbsp; My observation took place mainly at the corner of Lincoln St. and Gervais St.&nbsp; I spent the majority of my time sitting outside a Starbucks on the corner and surveying the entire Lincoln intersection.&nbsp; There were times when I walked up and down the street but ultimately ended back at the Starbucks intersection.&nbsp; From this location, I could observe the north and south of Lincoln Street as well as both cameras I decided to examine.</p>
<p>
	I chose to observe two cameras that were located on top of opposite street lights (refer to picture below) at the intersection of Lincoln Street and Gervais St.&nbsp; The reason I chose these two cameras was because of the constant traffic at this location.&nbsp; The few other cameras in the area weren&rsquo;t positioned near any type of commotion.&nbsp; I believe the two cameras were positioned to see not only the intersection, but the entirety of Lincoln Street.&nbsp; Due to the lack of other cameras in the area, I think these two were placed to make up for lost surveillance.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	I gathered a lot from my observations.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not going to say that people weren&rsquo;t aware of the cameras, because they were positioned quite obviously; but I just don&rsquo;t think they cared that much.&nbsp; There were times when someone would spot the camera at the last minute and hit their breaks thinking that would save them from being caught speeding.&nbsp; This could be because it was midday and people were rushing to get lunch before returning to work.&nbsp; Within fifteen minutes of arriving at the location, I witnessed someone drive through a red light, and a few more instances of the same throughout the day.&nbsp; The cameras didn&rsquo;t seem to hinder people too much.&nbsp; I did witness many police cars patrolling the area though; and when they were around, time seemed to slow down because people would drive slower and obey street signs, lights, etc&hellip;After they spotted the police, they continued down the road at a steady pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	This brings to our attention Richard Grusin&rsquo;s remarks about the anticipation of security.&nbsp; Implicitly we know we&rsquo;re being watched and/or recorded.&nbsp; This is anticipation&mdash;but very subtle.&nbsp; It is anticipation as Richard Grusin describes it.&nbsp; Anticipation works on the premise that &ldquo;data can be generated&rdquo; (142) so that dots can be connected about various events.&nbsp; Because we know this, we feel the safety of predictability.&nbsp; But in moments when it&rsquo;s made visible [police cars] we snap to attention with a sort of surprise.&nbsp; When people are confronted with the fact of security, subtle anticipation turns to awareness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Whether people were walking or driving, they were always on the move.&nbsp; Majority of the people walking went straight to Starbucks and then left.&nbsp; There weren&rsquo;t a whole lot of people lingering, it was just constant movement.&nbsp; I would say that the people walking were less aware of the cameras than the people driving.&nbsp; Many people throughout the day were crossing the streets where they saw fit. &nbsp;The crosswalks were rarely used.&nbsp; The first thought that develops when you spot the two cameras, is that they were placed on top of the stop lights to make drivers cautious of their actions.&nbsp; But this may be a tactic to deceive people.&nbsp; The cameras may not be paying attention to the car traffic at all; they may be surveying the pedestrians and businesses up and down Lincoln Street.&nbsp; I consider this quite likely.</p>
<p>
	Gervais Street is an extremely busy street: it leads further into the city and alongside the statehouse; but the cameras weren&rsquo;t surveying this street.&nbsp; They were monitoring the activity along Lincoln Street (or lack there of). There are a few attractions that are located among this street:&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.columbiaconventioncenter.com/"">The Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center</a> and two bars called Wild Hare and Bull Market tavern.&nbsp; The bars are a potential goldmine for surveillance enthusiasts, or to put it more simply, police.&nbsp; They attract young adults come nighttime with their weekly drink specials and huge crowds.&nbsp; This also makes it a targeted area for potential criminal and other deviant or illicit activity.&nbsp; As people leave the bars intoxicated, they could be inclined to drive or fall victim to accident or harm, both of which would be observed by these two cameras. The same situation occurs when the convention center has events.&nbsp; The street becomes flooded with traffic.&nbsp; Crowds are messy; and the cameras provide a means to keep an &ldquo;eye&rdquo; on the situation.&nbsp; I believe the cameras were strategically placed here for these purposes.</p>

<p>
	During my time observing Lincoln St., I began to realize how Michel Foucault&rsquo;s Panopticism exists in our everyday lives, even if it&rsquo;s in the most subtle of ways.&nbsp; The essential idea behind Foucault&rsquo;s Panopticism is the methodical controlling of human behavior through restrained and frequently unknown means.&nbsp; The two cameras on the stop lights suggest this same theory.&nbsp; Gervais Street appears to be surveyed and because of that, drivers on this street might act accordingly.&nbsp; Much like how in the movie <u>Red Road</u> (2006), the main antagonist, Clyde Henderson, is being surveyed constantly (he is a parolee) but is never certain of when he is being surveyed. &nbsp;Henderson is trying to go straight which shows a sign of his awareness of being watched.&nbsp; Because of this, we never really see Clyde misbehave on the surveillance cameras. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The two cameras I was observing were actually positioned to see north and south of Lincoln Street, covering the bars and the convention center, and other curious areas.&nbsp; The cameras seem to be controlling both streets with very little application.&nbsp; This strategy compliments Foucault&rsquo;s theory by reinforcing the uncertainty and therefore effortlessly influencing public behavior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The concept behind modern Panopticism provides some social stability: it prevents the idea of malicious conduct from actualizing.&nbsp; Everyday we are subject to observation; but it is a necessary evil.&nbsp; Should the thought of offensive behavior surface in us, the thought of being caught will supersede it.</p>

	Hiding In Public</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	On Wednesday June 15<sup>th</sup> from 10:30 a.m. &ndash; 12:30 p.m. I observed a surveillance camera in <a href=""http://www.cafecarolina.com/"">Carolina Caf&eacute;</a> at 925 Sumter Street,&nbsp;Columbia, SC 29201. This camera was positioned exactly over the door pointed straight ahead. The camera I chose in relation to the seat I chose to sit in had the best view of the four-way intersection, the door and the counter. The only traffic I had behind me was people using the restroom, which was far less busy than the front door traffic.</p>
<p>
	<img src=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/map.preview.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	This is a map of the general area of Carolina Caf&eacute;. I watched the camera on the far left for the duration of the project. Along with this camera are a couple of others in near sight and the collection of the cameras focus on one general area. The area is highlighted in blue where most of the action goes on in the caf&eacute; and the business makes sure they have plenty of surveillance from various angles. This is great in case of a robbery since the food products and cash register are in this vicinity. Not only robberies are the main focus, employee misconduct such as theft is key for the location of the cameras.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Listed are the observations I had of people who walked in the Carolina Caf&eacute;. It was a white model Samsung surveillance camera.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This still photograph shows the central location of the camera. If it were to catch a revealing act such as theft or any type of crime, it would be easy to reveal it to the public and the authorities, but we tend not to notice. Grusin describes a consequence of this sense of normalcy. There is a normalcy of being imaged all the time. We&rsquo;re not startled or surprised by cameras anymore. We ourselves, take pictures all the time. In his <em>Affect and Mediality</em> after 9/11 he states, &ldquo;They came into existence through ordinary media practices &ndash; taking digital photographs, burning them on CDs, uploading them on websites, and emailing them to friends and family &ndash; that were a piece with our own everyday media practices of photographing our pets, our vacations, or our loved ones, and then sharing these images with friends, family, or strangers via the same media of file sharing, email, social networking, mobile phones, and the web&hellip;&rdquo; (Grusin) However, in the case of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0896866/""><em>Standard Operating Procedure</em></a>, the person who began to take the photographs wanted to bring the Abu Ghraib situation to the public. In the back of her mind she was aware of the possibility that someone would be reprimanded, but not to the extent that everyone was punished. She&rsquo;s aware of taking pictures, but she doesn&rsquo;t realize what Grusin does. That it is normal to take pictures and in most instances automatically reach for a camera.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	As a whole this experiment consisted of me surveying the area surrounding the Carolina Caf&eacute; on the block of Main/Sumter/College/Pendleton streets. During this observation I found that cameras are almost non-existent. Other than ATMs and emergency poles located all across campus, this is the only camera easily visible from the street. Cameras may very well be in discrete locations on this block and would be good for safety reasons. I was surprised that the Byrnes building seemed not to have exterior cameras. The public could hold a state of anonymity on this block opposed to many blocks in downtown Columbia that are filled with cameras following your every move. In <em>How Little We Know of Our Neighbors </em>by Rebecca Baron there was almost no instance of public anonymity. In London when an average person is photographed 300 times a day with one camera for every 14 people, it is difficult to hide and remain anonymous in public.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	I assumed there would be a camera with a bird&rsquo;s eye view looking down on the corner for Sumter and College streets overlooking the Horseshoe. The Horseshoe is historic on the campus of the University of South Carolina because it was part of the original 1801 campus. Being the tallest building in the area, I assumed it would have cameras at various points, street level and aerial. This could be great for safety considering the traffic going through this area during school.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	During the actual experiment on day two I was relatively hiding in public because there were no disturbances with my observation time, while some of my classmates didn&rsquo;t have such luck. I kept to myself at a little table writing down every last detail about the customers, workers, and every person in or around the caf&eacute;. A sense of normalcy would be the best way to describe this project. No one approached me wondering what I was doing or why I had been there for so long without someone keeping me company. Nothing out of the ordinary occurred and people minded their business and went about their days in an average manner.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The sense of normalcy during the mass observation was anything but accidental. I walked into the caf&eacute; to order a muffin and a drink, which is considered normal for breakfast time at 10:30 a.m. Doing this it was almost as if I disarmed any worker or owner that could have been skeptical of a guy walking into a store strictly taking notes of the surroundings for two full hours. I did this not only to &ldquo;fit-in&rdquo;, but also to avoid any further problems if they happened to ask me to leave. Francois Ewald states, &ldquo;Normalization, then, is less a question of making products conform to a standard model than it is of reaching an understanding with regard to the choice of a model&hellip;Normalization is thus the production of norms, standards for measurement and comparison, and rules of judgment.&rdquo; (Ewald) The &ldquo;normal&rdquo; model would be a customer that walks in a caf&eacute; and makes a purchase. The understanding with regard would be the person recognizing they have made a choice to conform to this model rather than go astray by disregarding the standards for measurement and comparison.</p>

	Hiding In Public</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	On Wednesday June 15<sup>th</sup> from 10:30 a.m. &ndash; 12:30 p.m. I observed a surveillance camera in <a href=""http://www.cafecarolina.com/"">Carolina Caf&eacute;</a> at 925 Sumter Street,&nbsp;Columbia, SC 29201. This camera was positioned exactly over the door pointed straight ahead. The camera I chose in relation to the seat I chose to sit in had the best view of the four-way intersection, the door and the counter. The only traffic I had behind me was people using the restroom, which was far less busy than the front door traffic.</p>

<p>
	This is a map of the general area of Carolina Caf&eacute;. I watched the camera on the far left for the duration of the project. Along with this camera are a couple of others in near sight and the collection of the cameras focus on one general area. The area is highlighted in blue where most of the action goes on in the caf&eacute; and the business makes sure they have plenty of surveillance from various angles. This is great in case of a robbery since the food products and cash register are in this vicinity. Not only robberies are the main focus, employee misconduct such as theft is key for the location of the cameras.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Listed are the observations I had of people who walked in the Carolina Caf&eacute;. It was a white model Samsung surveillance camera.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This still photograph shows the central location of the camera. If it were to catch a revealing act such as theft or any type of crime, it would be easy to reveal it to the public and the authorities, but we tend not to notice. Grusin describes a consequence of this sense of normalcy. There is a normalcy of being imaged all the time. We&rsquo;re not startled or surprised by cameras anymore. We ourselves, take pictures all the time. In his <em>Affect and Mediality</em> after 9/11 he states, &ldquo;They came into existence through ordinary media practices &ndash; taking digital photographs, burning them on CDs, uploading them on websites, and emailing them to friends and family &ndash; that were a piece with our own everyday media practices of photographing our pets, our vacations, or our loved ones, and then sharing these images with friends, family, or strangers via the same media of file sharing, email, social networking, mobile phones, and the web&hellip;&rdquo; (Grusin) However, in the case of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0896866/""><em>Standard Operating Procedure</em></a>, the person who began to take the photographs wanted to bring the Abu Ghraib situation to the public. In the back of her mind she was aware of the possibility that someone would be reprimanded, but not to the extent that everyone was punished. She&rsquo;s aware of taking pictures, but she doesn&rsquo;t realize what Grusin does. That it is normal to take pictures and in most instances automatically reach for a camera.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	As a whole this experiment consisted of me surveying the area surrounding the Carolina Caf&eacute; on the block of Main/Sumter/College/Pendleton streets. During this observation I found that cameras are almost non-existent. Other than ATMs and emergency poles located all across campus, this is the only camera easily visible from the street. Cameras may very well be in discrete locations on this block and would be good for safety reasons. I was surprised that the Byrnes building seemed not to have exterior cameras. The public could hold a state of anonymity on this block opposed to many blocks in downtown Columbia that are filled with cameras following your every move. In <em>How Little We Know of Our Neighbors </em>by Rebecca Baron there was almost no instance of public anonymity. In London when an average person is photographed 300 times a day with one camera for every 14 people, it is difficult to hide and remain anonymous in public.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	I assumed there would be a camera with a bird&rsquo;s eye view looking down on the corner for Sumter and College streets overlooking the Horseshoe. The Horseshoe is historic on the campus of the University of South Carolina because it was part of the original 1801 campus. Being the tallest building in the area, I assumed it would have cameras at various points, street level and aerial. This could be great for safety considering the traffic going through this area during school.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	During the actual experiment on day two I was relatively hiding in public because there were no disturbances with my observation time, while some of my classmates didn&rsquo;t have such luck. I kept to myself at a little table writing down every last detail about the customers, workers, and every person in or around the caf&eacute;. A sense of normalcy would be the best way to describe this project. No one approached me wondering what I was doing or why I had been there for so long without someone keeping me company. Nothing out of the ordinary occurred and people minded their business and went about their days in an average manner.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The sense of normalcy during the mass observation was anything but accidental. I walked into the caf&eacute; to order a muffin and a drink, which is considered normal for breakfast time at 10:30 a.m. Doing this it was almost as if I disarmed any worker or owner that could have been skeptical of a guy walking into a store strictly taking notes of the surroundings for two full hours. I did this not only to &ldquo;fit-in&rdquo;, but also to avoid any further problems if they happened to ask me to leave. Francois Ewald states, &ldquo;Normalization, then, is less a question of making products conform to a standard model than it is of reaching an understanding with regard to the choice of a model&hellip;Normalization is thus the production of norms, standards for measurement and comparison, and rules of judgment.&rdquo; (Ewald) The &ldquo;normal&rdquo; model would be a customer that walks in a caf&eacute; and makes a purchase. The understanding with regard would be the person recognizing they have made a choice to conform to this model rather than go astray by disregarding the standards for measurement and comparison.</p>

	In early 2008, New Zealand&rsquo;s Victoria University submitted a proposal to merge its Film Studies department into a new school of &ldquo;Visual Culture&rdquo;. The proposal, which advocated the convergence of disciplines in the name of inter-disciplinary creativity, was heavily criticised by both staff and students, and was dismissed shortly after. The following year, the New Zealand government announced in its yearly budget that Victoria University&rsquo;s humanities faculty would lose $800,000NZD of funding (while the sciences enjoyed a 2.3 million dollar bump). Then, in December 2011, the university, under the guidance of an appointed working party, agreed to dismantle its Gender and Women&rsquo;s studies program (effective semester one 2011). Each of these events, for which there are numerous examples at New Zealand universities and abroad, are symptomatic of an ongoing crisis for humanities faculties around the world. Specifically, these examples signal the extension of the neoliberal paradigm and market logic into the university. However, this narrativebegins to frame such a crisis at the level of the institution and its government. What it elidesare the technologies of the self, and the conditions in which students themselves are encouraged to construct branded identities. Here, we offer a local account of New Zealand&rsquo;s higher education structures from the perspective of the student, arguing that this branding of the self folds back into university departments, as a result of their responsibility to facilitate this branding process through the adoption of a &lsquo;service&rsquo; logic. In turn, this process produces, and re-produces, the discursive networks that mediate the relationship between students and humanities programmes.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Prospective students in New Zealand, as in any other part of the world, are faced with a choice of direction in the type of study they wish to undertake, which is part of a much larger formation of selfhood. The discourse of personal transformation has always been part of higher education, from the stereotypical freshman to the mature student: both are entrenched in a journey to, as academics James Cot&eacute; and Anton Allahar put it, either &ldquo;find oneself&rdquo; or &ldquo;better oneself&rdquo; as &ldquo;architects of their own destiny&rdquo; (110). However, the rise of what Alison Hearn (2010) has termed &lsquo;the promotional&rsquo; (and distinctly neoliberal) university brings with it a language of personal responsibility, and a mentality dictated by market logic, where the journey of becoming is much more narrowly defined&mdash;that is, to pursue a career. In July of last year, New Zealand&rsquo;s Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce outlined the centre-right National Party-led Government&rsquo;s plan to directly link tertiary education funding to vocational output targets in a statement, which exemplifies neoliberal attitudes in the contemporary climate:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:36.0pt;"">
	I want to see funding linked to employment outcomes, not just internal benchmarks. This will send a strong signal to students about which qualifications and which institutions offer the best career prospects. And that&rsquo;s what tertiary education has got to be about (Binning).</p>
<p style=""margin-left:36.0pt;"">
<img alt="""" class=""ibimage"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/joyce.jpg"" style=""width: 302px; height: 262px; "" /></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"" />
<p>
	The message is clear, both in its objectives, but also in what is omitted. If university&rsquo;s primary role is the production of an educated workforce, then its traditional ability to function as a necessarily external space for the production of knowledge, and with a responsibility for societal critique, is clearly being eroded.</p>
<p>
	<strong>The Self-Branded Student and the &lsquo;Service&rsquo; Logic</strong></p>
<p>
	As external bodies stress the importance for vocational outputs from higher education (in New Zealand this is as much a part of public discourse as it is a governmental priority), students are not only fed the idea that universities are, in the words of Derek McCormack (chairman of New Zealand&rsquo;s Vice Chancellors&rsquo; Committee), becoming &ldquo;more and more like an employment agency&rdquo; (Beaumont), but furthermore, are warned of an increasingly competitive job market. The bottom line, we are told, is that graduates need to seek opportunities which will help them to &lsquo;stand above the crowd&rsquo;. One response is the construction of a self-brand, what Anothony Giddens calls &lsquo;the reflexive project of the self&rsquo;, which condenses a student&rsquo;s university experience into one aspect of a much larger personal branding project. Here, the self becomes a commodity, which is self-consciously produced via a series of &lsquo;meta-narratives&rsquo; and &lsquo;meta-images&rsquo; of the self-as-brand, &ldquo;through the use of cultural meanings and images drawn from narrative and visual codes of the mainstream culture industries&rdquo; (Hearn 197). By this logic, brands do not simply exist in a one-to-one relationship to their commodity referent, they also function as part of a wider visual context for consumption, where the brand becomes a locus for the mediation between the brander and the consumer (Hearn 2011).</p>
<p>
<img alt="""" class=""ibimage"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/personal_branding.jpg"" style=""width: 934px; height: 292px; "" /></p>
<p>
	The relationship between the brander and the brand gestures outwards, as a particular discourse informing the individual&rsquo;s relationship with the institution of the university, which is perceived as the provider of a service. In this model, students start to appear as autonomous &lsquo;choosers&rsquo;, perceiving education as what Hearn calls a &ldquo;zero-sum game, where they get [in the form of grades] what they pay for [in the form of capital or fees]&rdquo; (2010: 205). This upsets the hegemonic discourse of academia, where teaching staff are privileged as the sanctified purveyors of knowledge, and students are placed in the subordinate position of the relatively unknowledgeable learner. Under the neoliberal paradigm, lecturers are viewed as the providers of a service, while the individual, self-branding student perceives themself at the centre of a network of power-relations, which is heavily informed by the distinct logics of the marketplace. The end result is a pair of competing discourses: between the views of academic staff, and the new expectations of the self-branding students</p>
<p>
	The external representation of the branded self is the CV, a site where the various expressions of the personal brand are gathered for viewing and consumption by the marketplace of potential employers. The many hours, which the student has spent in tutorials, lectures, and computer labs become the means to a very specific, end here: the degree, which functions as a baseline signifier for &lsquo;employability&rsquo; in the contemporary job market. When a degree, papers and grades are displayed together in the format of the CV they are usually accompanied (and contextualised) by a listing of &lsquo;transferable skills&rsquo;, which, once acquired (at university, or elsewhere) are, in theory, applicable to any relevant professional opportunities that the student may be applying for.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="""" class=""ibimage"" src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/cv.jpg"" /></p>
<p>
	<strong>The Crisis of the Humanities</strong></p>
<p>
	The imperatives of the promotional/neoliberal university has implications for all faculties, but in different ways, as each school and department are forced to position themselves in accordance with a service logic. Indeed, some faculties are better suited to this logic than others; however, amongst the most threatened are the humanities. At the heart of this dilemma, lies a familiar paradoxical question: How can the humanities gain authorisation from external interests (government, industry, public), by answering the calls for productive workforces; all the while maintaining the core function of developing critical or analytical perspectives of society? In all likelihood, the inherent contradiction in this question will continuously bring those interested to a moot point. Nevertheless, the schools that make up the humanities are each assigned the task of negotiating this crisis by re-branding their discipline within the terms of a service logic, while desperately holding on to the foundations and histories of their particular field.</p>
<p>
	On behalf of its Media Studies department, Vicotria University&rsquo;s Career Development and Employment service released a <em>Career View</em> article (Dec 2005) outlining the media industry, the function of the department, the &lsquo;skills&rsquo; that students develop, and crucially, the career opportunities that are available where such skills are prerequisites. In this context, the article works to respond and position the department within the discourse of the &lsquo;university as service&rsquo;. However, in transferring the Media Studies department into a branding logic, the nature of the field; its methods, approaches, theoretical frameworks andresearch are, in the <em>Career View </em>document, essentialised down to a core set of banal skills: &ldquo;written communication skills, oral communication skills, relationship skills, leadership skills, research skills, analytical skills...&rdquo; Here, the rhetorical work of &lsquo;skills&rsquo; reveals how the <em>Career View</em> document is trying to appeal to various constituencies (future students, government, industry), allowing the department to make a broadly progressive sales pitch, while also eliding the tensions inherent in its &lsquo;service&rsquo;. By way of example, Media Studies&rsquo; <em>Career View</em> document explains how students in the program will gain valuable leadership skills: &ldquo;because they understand communication&rdquo; (4).The vague use of the buzz-word &ldquo;communication&rdquo; is supposed to explain why Media Studies students should make good leaders. The connection here is actually quite tenuous though, suggesting that students will acquire these skills through some kind of osmosis as a result of the group work, presentations and so on that are a regular part of the department&rsquo;s core curricula. The flexibility of the &lsquo;skills&rsquo; rhetoric, in that it comfortably mediates the humanities with the imperatives of the neoliberal university, makes up one part of the rationale for skill-basedthinking. Elsewhere however, &ldquo;skills&rdquo; are also evaluated against &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; to indicate a kind a prolonged value to the branded self. In a guideline to preparing a CV, the &lsquo;Victoria University Career Development and Employment&rsquo; service define skills as &ldquo;practisedability; expertise&rdquo;, and argue:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:36.0pt;"">
	The great thing about &#39;skills&#39; when compared to &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; is that skills do not date. It doesn&#39;t matter where your skills are acquired - at home, work, committee meetings, or as a member of a sports team, because once developed you can use them in any environment, industry, profession or occupation. (page ref)</p>
<p>
	Indeed, &ldquo;skills&rdquo; are &ldquo;transferable&rdquo; between multiple environments, and importantly, between departments, degrees, and jobs. Therefore, the rhetorical work of skills is also to standardise the degree itself, as <em>all</em> departments are essentialised down to these skill-sets, which often overlap with each other. The emphasis on superficial and easily digestible information is precisely what branding is all about. This process recalls Barthes&rsquo; bourgeois myth-makers, who draw on common cultural knowledge and recognisable stereotypes to produce and re-produce stories, images and discourses which are used by individuals, corporations and communities to define themselves, and their relationships to the world around them (Hearn 2011). But myths also mystify, and what the logic of the CV rendersinvisible are the heavily differentiated processes of knowledge, which individual departments have to offer students. Instead, the university experience of learning is reduced to a banal list of &lsquo;transferable skills&rsquo;, individual &lsquo;experiences&rsquo;, &lsquo;achievements&rsquo;, and an overly determined set of grade scores. When viewed in the context of the trend to vocationalise New Zealand&rsquo;s tertiary education system, these discourses also have an ideological resonance that by its very nature undermines the traditional role of the humanities. Universities like Victoria are now under increasing external pressure to align internal operations with external outputs, meaning that the practice by which a department can conflate certain aspects unique to its field with the marketing &lsquo;skill-set&rsquo; in a superficial document like <em>Career View</em> may no longer be enough to guarantee their prolonged existence under the neoliberal paradigm.</p>

The evictions of  Occupy sites nationwide, especially at Zuccotti Park, have created a new hybrid by categorizing political protest as a health and safety issue, but then responding to it with the weapons of counterinsurgency. For the past few days, Occupy locations have reverberated to the sound of the force of law. I mean this literally. I was awakened at 3.30am on November 15 by the sound of what I think were helicopters above lower Manhattan. The combination of police barricades and the closure of the subways meant that no one could get closer to the eviction of Zuccotti Park. Even the airspace was closed, not to prevent the Occupy air force from deploying but to keep out the news channel helicopters. Once again, we are reminded to ""move on, there's nothing to see here.""

The park itself was suddenly flooded with klieg lighting, blinding those trying to sleep. From the Twitter feed, email and later news accounts, it's also emerged that Long Range Acoustic Devices (LRAD) were used to disperse the crowd with painful sound blasts. The LRAD was developed as a weapon of counterinsurgency after the attack on the USS Cole in 2000 by al-Qai'da and is now mounted on certain NYPD vehicles. After a set of legal maneuvers, the park was opened to the public, with the stipulation that no one can sleep there. The result was that ""anyone found lying down and even a few of those who tried to sleep sitting up were woken by security guards for Brookfield Properties."" The private corporation now has its own security force on the streets of New York, rendering Zuccotti into the latest outpost of Baghdad-Kabul Inc., the 60 billion-a-year cash-fest for private security firms.

In short, we have a full range of counterinsurgency tactics being deployed from noise and light violence to sleep deprivation and the now infamous destruction of books.

Reverting to its standard deference to counterinsurgency, the New York Times described how:

    The mayor and his advisers had grown fed up with their inability to police the park, with complaints about noise, disruptions to businesses and odors, and with a leaderless movement that they just could not figure out how to deal with.

Never mind that recent articles had shown there were more complaints about the noise from Ground Zero building work than from Zuccotti. Or that most of the failings here are on the city side: an inability to police must not be tolerated.

A few miles northwest of Zuccotti is the Cardozo Law School where Jacques Derrida delivered his epic essay ""The Force of Law"" in 1989. Reading an early essay by Walter Benjamin Critique of Violence (1921), Derrida pointed out that it is only in English that one can speak of ""enforcing"" the law. Both writers showed that law is, in the last analysis, only force but that it does everything it can to sustain what Montaigne long ago called ""the mystical foundation of authority."" It is that claim to authority, the ability to determine the relation between the sayable and the visible, which I have called visuality.

    NY Times photo showing klieg lights in action

If this deconstruction is what one might expect from Derrida, his conclusion pushed beyond the scholastic definitions of ""politics"" and ""theory"" to show why Occupy is perceived as a threat to the state that requires counterinsurgency tactics. Developing Benjamin's assertion that a general strike is ""the right to use force""--which is not at all the same as violence--on the part of labor in the same way that the state claims the right to enforce law, Derrida asserted:

    There is something of the general strike, and thus of the revolutionary situation in every reading that founds something new and that remains unreadable in regard to established canons and norms of reading that is to say the present state of reading of what figures the State, with a capital S, in the state of possible reading.

For Bloomberg, the New York Times and the other mediatic apparatus of the one percent, Occupy is and remains unreadable so it must be eliminated as pollution.

Asserting at his press conference that the decision to evict was ""mine alone,"" Bloomberg sought to restore the authority of the State for his one percent class. His comment made it clear first that he wished to be regarded as the heroic leader, justifying his claim to authority; and that he had simply decided in the manner of King George and consulted no lawyers or other functionaries, let alone the lonely occupant of the White House, who once again missed his opportunity.

Bloomberg's action was then a classic admission of failure, the failure to understand and communicate. In an indication of the absurdity of it all, the simple tent has now become the latest purported weapon of insurgency, banned from Zuccotti--but not Union Square, where a large tented holiday market is up until December 25. Tents were even banned from sale anywhere near the Occupy London site at St Paul's Cathedral. Today the City of London Corporation filed an eviction notice to Occupy London, specifically indicating that ""the Orders sought will not prevent lawful and peaceful protest in this general area and is directed at the tents and other structures."" Serious legal debate is being pursued relating to the right to bear sleeping-bags.

When the veil was banned in France, the performance duo Niqabitch parodied the ban by wearing a niqa with miniskirts.

On the N17 demonstrations, and thereafter, let's wear tents in whatever way we can.

Benjamin understood the general strike to be different from an ordinary strike “in the determination to resume only a wholly transformed work, no longer enforced by the state, an upheaval that the strike not so much causes as consummates.” In this way, most of the strikes cited by Rosa Luxemburg in her 1906 pamphlet on the general strike were local, spontaneous actions. These strikes were “general” not because everyone took part but because their aim was a general transformation and renunciation of domination. Benjamin saw this vision of revolt as not being violent but rather as “deep, moral, and genuinely revolutionary.” The right to look. The invention of the other. Or even, as Arundhati Roy put it today to OWS, ""the right to dream.""","Counterinsurgency in NYC vs the OWS general strike","Unpublished",NULL,14644,NULL,"3815, 2593, 3857","0, 1, 2","sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/evicting_zuccotti.jpg, sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/zoltan_11_15.jpg, sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/zuccotti_11_15_i.jpg"
14650,"contributed_pieces",5458,"Think Local, Act Global",1,1321473345,1321507701,2,"The Tea Party’s claim to speak for the silent majority is now a distant memory, replaced by Occupy Wall Street’s slogan “We are the 99%” which lays its own claim on the voice of the people. Like the Tea Party, OWS too points out the disempowerment of the people by powerful institutions, but, the similarity evaporates almost before it registers. While one can imagine people being members of both movements or agreeing whole-heartedly on certain economic reforms, OWS and the Tea Party construct “the people” as a civic, social, or political subject in a crucially different manner.

From my position on the political outside of the Tea Party, its genealogy, allegiances, debts and allies seem comfortably clear: libertarians, nativists, white ressentiment-ists, conservative Republicans, and a sprinkling of others who found it the only tent willing to grant them refuge. Looking at Occupy Wall Street from the political inside, as someone hailed by their message, I find it harder to identify its genealogy, allegiances, debts and allies and, thus, find it harder to figure out who is addressed by the claim, “we are the 99%.” 

The obvious question (channeling Hazel Carby here [fn]Hazel V. Carby, White Women Listen! Black Feminism and the Boundaries of Sisterhood, in Black British Cultural Studies: A Reader, eds. Houston A. Baker, Manthia Diawara & Ruth H. Lindeborg, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996) pp. 61-86[/fn]) is to ask what “you” mean by saying “we” are the 99%? The claim is incredibly powerful, all the more so, for its grandly sweeping inclusiveness that equally hails the homeless person on the street and the successful plastic surgeon who brings in a high six-figure income each year. And, here is where it becomes tricky, because the 99% is clearly not a descriptive title as much as it is an invitation to identify with a particular political orientation. So, even though it technically includes the newly-minted Ivy League graduate now working for Goldman Sachs, it really doesn’t want her as she is. Similarly, the Occupy encampments have had to make their sometimes-tense, often tricky, and intensely scrutinized negotiations with those whose existing encampments have been occupied.

How do “we” respond to the call of “We are the 99%”? Who feels uneasy and who feels recognized? Who has to adapt and who feels at home? Does it spring from a sense of outrage at what was done to “us” or what has been done to “all of us” for so long? Do “we” take up the placard because “this has gone too far” or because “this has gone on for too long”?

Even with a deep appreciation for the hard work of committing to participatory, consensual democracy that is the centerpiece of Occupy, I find it difficult not to bring up questions of race, gender, class, nationality, politics in a self-reflexive moment about the positionality of the subject “we are the 99%.” It is tempting (and, largely, fair) to respond to these questions by variously pointing to the diversity of the movement(s), by claiming that now is not the time, or by saying that “we” are addressing these issues already in an ongoing dialogue. But, I would suggest that it is exactly these still-uncomfortable questions that must be the starting point for coalition and not the alliances sought out or bridges built after a political subject has begun to coalesce. It would be nice if the “we” did not start off as a renegade splinter group from the hegemonic. 

In the long interregnum between social movements in the USA, the whole point of political and cultural theory was our obsession with “difference,” specifically with the temporality of difference—the deferral of race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, nationality etc. etc. in the anti-war movement, the civil rights movement, the women’s liberation movement, the anti-colonial movements, the gay rights movement etc. etc. The “fierce urgency of now” never quite applied to all of us. In our discussions of post-modernism, post-structuralism, post-Marxism, post-colonialism, we talked about intersectionality, about the impossibility of parsing out difference except in carefully circumscribed analytic ways, about the pernicious narratives of entry into world history, about embracing agonistic multiplicity rather than consensual unity, about the reversibility of power and the necessary recognition of privilege, about learning to listen as well as speak, and about different ways of speaking and being. 

And then, suddenly, in the euphoria of the Arab Spring and the hope of the American Fall, “we” became hopeful that change might actually happen, that the people whose voices can actually be heard might start saying things “we” could agree with. And, with a tinge of anxiety that this phenomenon, this moment might be more a soufflé than a sturdy loaf of sourdough, we are reluctant to open the oven door even to take a peek at what might be baking inside. But, then, what did we learn from those decades of theory if not that theory and practice are inseparable, that what seems natural and organic is cultural, that there is no anteriority to practice, that affect is not apolitical, that coalition cannot be built on deferral, that politics cannot be read off the body? Yes, there are all kinds of people participating, but, equally, yes, there are separate interest groups and websites emerging for people of color. How do we understand this? Yes, it is incredibly exciting to finally once again, see a popular critical awareness of the social cost of corporate capitalism after so many years of fighting the culture wars. But, as others have asked, how do we move forward without losing the insight gained from the struggle on the terrain of culture?

In the call to Occupy Wall Street, the intensely-local signifier (a few blocks in lower Manhattan) points to a vast and vastly complex global financial-industrial-political system. How is the globality of Wall Street understood and refracted (mirrored?) by Occupy Wall Street? The anti/alter-globalization movement exhorted us to “think global, act local” while corporations had, in an instance of practical theoretics par excellence, been practicing “think local, act global” by localizing global brands and gaining our consent to their global regime.

The success of the Occupy/We are the 99% movement has been its decentralized incarnation across the country. But, I want to ask, is “We are the 99%” an empty signifier à la Laclau & Mouffe [fn]Ernesto Laclau & Chantal Mouffe, Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics (London: Verso, 2001)[/fn], or is it a global brand à la Jay-Z selling Occupy T-shirts? Can the radical indeterminacy of the signifier be sustained in the face of local demands? Can it keep from collapsing into a global brand that carefully manages local instantiations? If “the 99%” differ globally, or even nationally, what then might bring them together in a universal demand? A structural demand for equitable distribution of resources? A demand against hoarding? A demand for transparent governance? A mode of living and being in common? Or, maybe, is it localism (of an ecological variety) that can sustain the global? In forging a complex unity, ironically Occupy/We are the 99% might work better as a global brand than as an empty signifier since the former neatly sidesteps the problem of incompatible local desires. On the other hand, Occupy/We are the 99% as a brand runs the danger of ignoring the fundamental lesson that the role of privilege is to join and support, not build and lead. 

Alternately, to think of Occupy/We are the 99% as an empty signifier forces us to continually ask who “we” are and to interrogate the adequacy of Occupy/We are the 99% as a signifier. As the accounts from Occupy Oakland, Occupy Atlanta and (un)Occupy Albuquerque demonstrate, all politics is local. Are the 99% in Oakland the same as the 99% in New York? Or, even, are the 99% in West Harlem the same as the 99% in lower Manhattan? Going global, would the 99% in France want the same thing as the 99% in Malaysia? 

Despite the many maps showing (un)Occupy movements across the United States and the world, is the whole world really watching? Or are people engaged in their own long-standing struggles for economic justice, political freedoms and social equality? To give a random, but hopefully illustrative example, did the 2006 election of Evo Morales in Bolivia (a modest victory in the grand scale of things) even register with most Americans? Was it not a political moment to celebrate and cherish? The public acknowledgment of inspiration and indebtedness to Egyptians and Spaniards is heartening, but I still feel uneasy reading the casual use of terms like “the revolution continues worldwide” [my emphasis] on the banner of www.occupywallstreet.org.  It begs the question of the kind of global imagination we see in the Occupy movement. 
 
bell hooks’ careful unpacking of the slogan, “the personal is political,” points out that “if the personal and the political are one and the same, then there is no politicization, no way to become the radical feminist subject.” [fn]bell hooks, Feminist Politicization: A Comment, in Talking Back: Thinking Feminist, Thinking Black (Boston: South End Press, 1989), p. 106[/fn] I agree completely with those who argue that the power and beauty of Occupy Wall Street lies in the becoming of political subjects, in flexing our political agency, in occupying public space and rediscovering the body politic, in refusing the separation of spheres of human activity, and in living and feeling community—basically, in insisting the personal is political. In the face of this, the rigidity of formalized demands comprehensible in the existing political frameworks is, indeed, an unnecessary foreclosure of what might be baking in the oven. 

However, as hooks points out, to recognize the possibility of performing differently, of noting a different trajectory for political subjects, of valuing the myriad ways of being embodied subjects, of remembering that the political is deeply personal does not disrupt this process, it simply keeps the space open for this process to expand indefinitely. For example, in the midst of this moment, can “we” keep in mind what the Comrades from Cairo said as they gently reminded Occupy that they have joined “years-long struggles by people and popular movements” and reassured them that “we are all watching one another now, and from Cairo we want to say that we are in solidarity with you, and we love you all for what you are doing.” Ask yourself, how the “we” in that statement fits in with the “we” in “we are the 99%”?

In the foregrounding of demands to eradicate unfair student debt, is there room to also fully acknowledge the debt owed (most recently) to students, workers, and citizens in North Africa and southern Europe? Why not call the movement American indignados? Is it possible to avoid asking to what extent the 99% in the United States are part of the global 1%? This is not simply a rhetorical question to highlight obvious disparities. Rather, it is my hope, my utopian impossible demand, my vision of social justice that the American revolution not take place first in America.

<p>
	October 28th. After weeks of impossibly upbeat posts (impossible because no movement can have an ever-upward arc), I finally sounded a worried note.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	My blog for that day:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	<em>This afternoon, there was intense rain. Although the tents stayed up, most people decamped to a nearby church, as well as the public atrium at 60 Wall Street. Someone said, &ldquo;There may be snow tomorrow&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m wondering how long protesters can hold the park, with their minimal tents, as temperatures drop further. Before the winter sets in and manages to clear Zuccotti (Liberty Plaza), exactly as the city hopes will happen, it&rsquo;s very important that people figure out where affinity groups, infrastructure, and networks will go next. The movement needs to evolve beyond holding on to this one block of city land.<a href=""#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1"" title=""""><strong>[i]</strong></a></em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	October 29th. The previous night&rsquo;s meeting at <em>16 Beaver</em> was about &ldquo;Artists. Role in the Occupy Movement.&rdquo; The presentations went on too long, the discussion section was shorted and frustration about lack of holistic thinking was in the air. Online, the Arts &amp; Culture committee was vibrant, but face to face, some members keep expressing worry about what will come next. In the middle of the meeting, Beka Economopoulos of <em>Not An Alternative</em> gets an SMS about a security issue at the park. Later, she says to me, &ldquo;Holding on to, and maintaining, Zuccotti Park, is taking up all the energy of the organizers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	That day, my blog had a change in tone. Now I finally mentioned what I had left out of the previous day&rsquo;s post. Beka had reminded me that there were many worries beside cold weather.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	<em>The success of the movement has attracted hustlers and provocateurs. When rain had driven people to the church and there were only a few &ldquo;peacekeepers&rdquo; at the site, two very aggressive men used that opportunity to try to start a fight over each other&rsquo;s signs (&ldquo;you got to take that sign down&rdquo;). The police watched and did nothing. I had the feeling they did not mind. The colder it gets, the fewer people at the site, the more these negative elements will have space to flex muscle. The media is also waiting for that moment, of course.</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	<em>Do we have to make a fetish out of this space? The dedicated organizers already have their meetings at 60 Wall Street and elsewhere. Work is getting done in small groups. The &ldquo;Spoke&rdquo; model passing in General Assembly is an acknowledgment of that fact. Why not spread the movement to other decentralized locations? In fact, why not use some of the money donated to the OWS movement to rent a large space for a year, and use that as an organizational hub. </em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	A few days later, Caroline Busta from the Wall Street Occupennial artist group highlights an article by Matt Harvey about destructive elements within the movement. Among other saboteur elements, the article highlights Gary Phenof:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	<em>With his bear-like size and self-professed &ldquo;combative style,&rdquo; Gary Phenof, a 50-something Staten Islander would be hard to miss in any crowd. Wearing a Russian hat, waving a full-size main-land China flag and giving out copies of the China Daily&mdash;even at the far edge of Zuccotti Park&mdash;Phenof stuck out like a sore thumb.<a href=""#_edn2"" name=""_ednref2"" title=""""><strong>[ii]</strong></a></em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	I look at the photograph of Phenof and realize this is the same man who started the argument on the day of the heavy rains. Interestingly, he started it just when most people were taking refuge from the rain in the church, so there were very few peacekeepers around. It seemed designed to cause maximum harm and bad press. Agent provocateur.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	I hesitate to highlight this news because I worry they will take the wind out of the movement. What should we do? But how can we stay silent as race/gender safe spaces erode&hellip;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Chris Kasper pointed out:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	<em>I think not talking about this presents us with more of a threat to take the wind out of the movement than getting it out and talking about it. I think the erosion of safe places makes it more urgent to talk about. We&rsquo;ve survived infiltration by James O&rsquo;keefe, right wing attack ads, &rdquo;oath keepers&rdquo; and other libertarian groups, a bs Brookfield eviction, police violence and are having some success mediating with the drummers. We need to find a way to work through this if we want the movement to go further.</em></p>

Although credited for giving the first call for September 17<sup>th </sup>(along with Anonymous, who seem to have lost interest as OWS became mainstream), Adbusters had been quieter in the discussions around the movement. But this new briefing called for regrouping as winter approached:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	<em>We declare &quot;victory&quot; and throw a party &hellip; a festival &hellip; a potlatch &hellip; a jubilee &hellip; a grand gesture to celebrate, commemorate, rejoice in how far we&#39;ve come, the comrades we&#39;ve made, the glorious days ahead. Imagine, on a Saturday yet to be announced, perhaps our movement&#39;s three month anniversary on December 17, in every #OCCUPY in the world, we reclaim the streets for a weekend of triumphant hilarity and joyous revelry. We dance like we&#39;ve never danced before and invite the world to join us. Then we clean up, scale back and most of us go indoors while the die-hards hold the camps. We use the winter to brainstorm, network, build momentum so that we may emerge rejuvenated with fresh tactics, philosophies, and myriad projects ready to rumble next Spring.</em><a href=""#_edn3"" name=""_ednref3"" title="""">[iii]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	I say prescient because, the night after this briefing comes out, New York City launches the notorious 1 am surprise raid that clears out Zuccotti and destroys two months worth of infrastructure (claims that all of it can be recovered from compounds are later proven false, as with the largely missing 5000 book People&rsquo;s Library).</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	By the way, I am always reminded by others to call it &ldquo;Liberty Plaza&rdquo;, but the November 15<sup>th</sup> action reminds us that the state will continue to try to enforce &ldquo;Zuccotti&rdquo;, by force. Should we continue to trying this rebranding, this &ldquo;liberation&rdquo;, or find other, more hospitable, Liberty Plazas?</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The day after the raid, Noah Fischer, one of the organizers of Occupy Museums, sounds exhausted on his Facebook wall, highlighting how the city&rsquo;s repressive tactics are burning up our precious energies:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	<em>So for the rest of the middle of the night and early morning, we few hundred people leaving the park or rushing to the scene got caught up in a demoralizing series of police traps in lower Manhattan&hellip; </em></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	<em>In the morning, there was an attempt to &ldquo;take&rdquo; another park on Canal Street. That failed, since the space was ominously enclosed like a big trap, and most people left before the police forcibly removed the hard-core protesters.</em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Yes, the struggle is also the movement. As resistance has mounted, the movement has grown. In a display of battering ram polemics, Keith Olbermann calls Mayor Bloomberg a valuable asset to the Occupy movement:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	<em>American freedom has not flourished in spite of these morons of history, it has flourished because of them &mdash; because they overreacted, because they under-thought, overreached, under-understood&hellip; Who else but a clich&eacute; like Bloomberg could take a protest beginning to grow a little stale around the edges and vault it back in the headlines, complete with mortifying scenes of police dressed as storm troopers, carrying military weapons, using figurative bazookas to kill figurative mosquitoes? &hellip; </em></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">
	<em>Who else but the epitome of tone-deafness that is Bloomberg could have better illustrated the fundamental issue of Occupy, when he puts the entire weight of the most people-driven city in the history of the Earth behind already-crushingly rich and their efforts to grab themselves still more advantages from those people and he, himself, is the 12th richest man in America? Who else but a publicity addict like Bloomberg could have enabled the arrest of 700 protesters on the Brooklyn Bridge and yet, two months later, frozen 20 square miles of New York City in gridlock traffic over two days, so somebody could film another goddamned Batman movie on the 59th Street Bridge?<a href=""#_edn4"" name=""_ednref4"" title=""""><strong>[iv]</strong></a></em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	So indeed, it is true, through his &ldquo;get a job&rdquo; moralizing, bullying tactics and this raid, coordinated with other city mayors across America (inadvertently blurted out by Mayor Quan), Bloomberg has repeatedly galvanized the movement. The evening after the raids, an hour after the park was finally reopened, the crowds at the General Assembly had gone up tenfold. I couldn&rsquo;t remember a recent GA that had been this large in the last few weeks. The air was electric again. But this energy can also be misleading, we should not be seduced into thinking temporarily being &ldquo;allowed back&rdquo; into the park, is what is best for the movement.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Even some of the more junior police officers look exhausted and tired of this endless policing of peaceful protests. A group of officers in CPR (Community Police Relations) jackets try to make some GA attendees get off a park ledge where they are sitting, citing concerns about &ldquo;safety.&rdquo; Within moments, the meeting is interrupted and &ldquo;let them sit / let them sit&rdquo; chants fill the air. I don&#39;t find this a jubilant or important moment. The officers are very junior (interestingly, all African-American), and probably too scared to go back to their commanding officer and say &ldquo;Sir, they want to continue sitting.&rdquo; Is this confrontation the best use of our energy?</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	After the GA ends, Haig Aivazian who had been at many earlier GAs said to me:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:22.5pt;"">
	<em>There is no sense in being prisoners to our own symbolism, and there is no need to exhaust ourselves for sheer hard headedness. All for a park that is increasingly limited, policed, trivialized and symbolic. There is a victory in today&rsquo;s mass showing, but it is also a perfect time to rethink the strategy. Let us fragment the struggle, make it networked and decentralized&ndash; like the forms of capital we are opposing. And reclaim Liberty Square whenever we please for GA.</em></p>
<p>
	<br />
	The next day, November 16<sup>th</sup>, there is rain all afternoon. On ustream (which had stayed live when livestream was knocked off air after the raid) the &ldquo;other99&rdquo;cameraman was broadcasting again from Zuccotti and saying, &ldquo;People, please come down here. Our numbers are small today. The CNN truck is here. We need to show them we have numbers in the park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Behind him the camera picks up scattered groups of wet protesters, and just as many police officers and park officials. Apparently Fox News was jubilantly declaring &ldquo;Occupy is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Why do we need to show CNN or Fox anything? We are meant to be building alternative systems for our future, not participating in the mainstream media&rsquo;s 15 minutes of flickering interest circus.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We do not have endless energy to spare, to wage daily cat and mouse sorties with the police (&ldquo;Miss, no standing at the intersection&rdquo; the moment someone even slows down their pace). At the end of the day, the police are still drawing overtime, so they can rationalize it by saying, &ldquo;this is my job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	What do we get from this endless rubbing up against police barricades? Personally I am really tired of going on marches while being penned in by those interlocked metal barricades.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We need to save some energy, to organize, create and build&hellip; elsewhere.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Astra Taylor, co-editor of a forthcoming Verso Books anthology of OWS essays, says:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:22.5pt;"">
	<em>A semi-permanent encampment is not the only way to occupy. And tweaking our methods may actually help make the movement more inclusive, as not everyone who is sympathetic to OWS can or wants to commit to living full-time in a tent. The Occupy movement, after all, was never about holding a single piece of ground, but changing the world.<a href=""#_edn5"" name=""_ednref5"" title=""""><strong>[v]</strong></a></em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Two other organizers, Zolt&aacute;n Gl&uuml;ck and Manissa McCleave Maharawal, write of the need to focus back on our important tasks:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:22.5pt;"">
	<em>This spectacle of repression should not distract us from the important tasks we have at hand, nor should it overshadow the great strides we&rsquo;ve made in the past months. There is no evicting a movement&hellip; </em></p>
<p style=""margin-left:22.5pt;"">
	<em>We are just beginning. Working groups from OWS have meetings and events planned for months ahead. They will continue to meet and they will continue to grow.<a href=""#_edn6"" name=""_ednref6"" title=""""><strong>[vi]</strong></a></em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	I just looked at the New York General Assembly&rsquo;s Calendar of Events. Starting off with the first week, when this looked like a simple Google Calendar, it has ballooned out to an endless list of events. For today, there are multiple events every hour on the hour. Looking down, I see the page button goes up to 1,452.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Page 1,452 shows that the event calendar has items (set on &ldquo;repeat daily&rdquo; or &ldquo;weekly&rdquo;) all the way up to December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2012. Planning events for a year from now seems slightly fanciful. Then again, it also seems optimistic.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	A colleague who is a lawyer defending homeowners against foreclosures reminds me that we need to be reflective, celebratory, practical, forward-looking, and inspiring -- all at once. So let us start on a macro and micro, holistic and granular level. Find a project, an affinity group, an alternative art space, a progressive organizing space, a classroom, an immigrant rights group, a trade union; anything, everything, somewhere in your neighborhood, in your city. Start building something specific, tangible&ndash; linked to the larger Occupy project of economic justice and resisting corporate control over democracy. &nbsp;All in preparation for spring, when people will start coming out in large numbers again. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to go against some of the fetish of horizontalism; the movement needs some leaders as well. Time to move to the second phase.</p>

	Abstract: This post reflects on the spatial organization of the Occupy Philadelphia camp outside City Hall, and in particular investigates-self conscious efforts to create an image of activism through the reuse, and display of signage.&nbsp; It suggests that even though the various Occupy movements rely heavily on virtual and social media materiality, and the raw, serve as crucial aesthetic mechanisms to generate a sense of authenticity and urgency.</p>
<p>
	<img height=""253"" src=""file:///Users/caitlinbruce/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip/0/clip_image002.png"" width=""308"" /></p>
<p>
	Walking down Market Street my partner and I turned towards City Hall&mdash;I wanted to go through the walkway inside the building plaza to see if a mural project I had visited some months ago was still there, since it was covering construction.&nbsp; We found all four entrances obstructed, curious for a major pedestrian thoroughfare, and went around the building, finding a large encampment spread across the north side of the edifice.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Occupy&rdquo; many signs said, some handmade, some typed, some laminated while others on raw cardboard.&nbsp; Wandering around the camp, which had at one pm on a Sunday during the feel of a music festival, with campers having food, hanging out in the sunlight, and playing with dogs during a lull between events.&nbsp; An assortment of different kinds of tents could be seen, with varying signs: a Quaker prayer tent, a Ron Paul campaign poster, a Sukkah, &ldquo;Eat more Food,&rdquo; among many others, creating a bricolage of political, religious and aesthetic affiliations.&nbsp; &nbsp;Although the Occupy is accused of being without demand, and largely coordinates actions through social media, a walk through an encampment reveals that first that &ldquo;demands&rdquo; are both explicit and in the process of constantly being framed and reframed, and second that social media is not used at the exclusion of the material&mdash;public spaces are actively shaped to re-imagine political potential through the reclamation of public space.&nbsp; The cardboard sign provides a crucial fulcrum for generating a sense of publicity and message.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Part of the reason for violent reactions against Occupy participants is an underlying fear of genuinely public space on the part of city managers, elites, and police.&nbsp; For space to be truly public it needs to be up for grabs, open to many different forms of life, of communication, and can get messy.&nbsp; A characteristic element of urban space in major U.S. cities is that &ldquo;developed&rdquo; urban centers are glossy and smooth: they invite flows of commerce, of people, of transportation, but not accumulation, a sense of safety and attraction without intimacy-- space that contours but does not hold.&nbsp; This is one reason why there have been so many wars against homelessness, since they are a population that pushes space to its seams, using it more than a conduit, the products of the privatization of public resources in the hollowing out of the welfare state.&nbsp; In <em>Right to the City</em> Don Mitchell charts the relationship between the eradication of public space and the war against the homeless, and in &ldquo;Aesthetics of Superfluity&rdquo; Achille Mbembe articulates the ways in which colonial cities require architectural environments that promote flow rather than dwelling in order to prevent confrontation with some of the uglier elements of colonial legacies.&nbsp; Both of these arguments illuminate my surface reading of one of the aesthetic strategies at work in the Occupy Philadelphia campsite.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Across from the information tent, and the information bulletin board, a palimpsest of different notices, and signs a combination of printouts and handwritten papers, is a horizontal wall of signs on the sidewalk, on the western periphery of the camp.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shut it down,&rdquo; &ldquo;We are the People&hellip;Really,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jah Bless the Jobless,&rdquo; &ldquo;Subprime Lenders Targeted Black and Brown People,&rdquo; &ldquo;Racism in the Movement Divides Ou Power,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey pampered CEOs, Shine Your Own Shoes!&rdquo; &ldquo;Education Gap &szlig;&gt; Income Gap,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stop the Humanitarian Bombing in Libya!&rdquo; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t believe that corporations are people until Texas executes one,&rdquo; &ldquo;End corporate influence this is not true democracy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Respect the ground, don&rsquo;t litter,&rdquo; &ldquo;Our kids futures are not for sale,&rdquo; &ldquo;People- Revolt,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fox News Lies,&rdquo; and so forth</p>
<p>
	The signs, crumpled, sometimes laid one on top of the other, often ripped from pizza and banana boxes display an kind of vulnerability and making-do.&nbsp; They are not typed out, they are not laminated and they are hand written suggesting imperfection but also unrepeatability.&nbsp; The signs are not grandiose, they are humble, and form an ephemeral archive of previous demonstrations.&nbsp; One could say that it is historical but the encampment&nbsp; gestures to a model of politics which does not operate based on spectacular events but rather through rehabilitating the everyday: whatever demonstration, tent decoration, or pole marker that the signs had served as in their vertical life times is not separated from their horizontal present.&nbsp; They mark a connection between politics as a form of life and shape for communal action.</p>
<p>
	However, the signs also form a point of entry for new publics.&nbsp;&nbsp; David Henkin argued that signs are &ldquo;captions&rdquo; for dynamic urban landscapes that communicate with other signs even if they are working for different goals and &ldquo;confirm and enhance&rdquo; each other (52, 55). &nbsp;The gathering of cardboard salutations mentioned above clearly do not offer a unified narrative that admits to a clear endpoint to Occupy&rsquo;s action.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead they illuminate on the level of the visual the democratic potential that Occupy by trying to expand circuits of communication and the range actors who can participate in a city&rsquo;s public life.&nbsp; The signs, a form of address used by politics, education, and commerce as well cuts across different publics (Henkin 174) and allows people to cultivate orientations to public space.</p>
<p>
	If anything Occupy is an ongoing performance against the superfluity that has characterized a liquefied market economy and a general orientation to non-spectacular life in the United States.&nbsp; Not immediately legible, not sleek, mistaken as debris, and trite unrest the signage placed on the edge of the encampment attests to an elongated form of politics, one based on using ordinary, even low-grade materials, in common space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The City of Philadelphia is planning to evict occupiers at the time of writing this post, November 27<sup>th</sup> at 5pm.&nbsp; Homes, people, and the fragile signs will be forcibly removed to return the City Hall plaza to a superfluous space of low, rather than place of dwelling.&nbsp; Specifically, for a $50 million construction project to begin on Dilworth plaza, another privatization of public space. It is important to note that this movement has also created a space for Philadelphia&#39;s homeless to dwell with less molestation from authorities-- this displacement merely repeats, and is not too different from the series of displacements of homeless that occur in cities across the country on a normalized basis.&nbsp; The archive of signs on the plaza are&nbsp; not aesthetically different from the signs that homeless people use to gain visibility, handwriting being both of necessity and an important way to signal embodied vulnerability. Don Mitchell&#39;s suggestion: that that the right to the city is at its basis a right to exist, is sadly undesrcored by these events.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the wake of this impending destruction, the Occupy facebook feed has showed messages urging supporters to document the displacement and potential confrontation, creating yet another archive of the ephemeral, demonstrating the importance of marking, bearing witness to, creating a set of signs to point to ongoing social dislocations in rapidly evaporating public space.</p>

<p>
	Listen. We have got a gobsmacking plum of a story stuffed with all manner of characters and curiosities &mdash; a complex mythology seamlessly woven through tiny gaps we found in the unfinished fabric of US history. It&rsquo;s got war and betrayal, arson and espionage. It&rsquo;s literally on fire. We need you to help us play this out.</p>

Oh, and we&rsquo;ve hidden slices of it in various historic places, old documents, and artifacts. And you, the player, happen to be a 13-year-old eighth grader. It&rsquo;s not that you don&rsquo;t like to read, truly. It&rsquo;s just that, if given a choice, you&rsquo;d rather watch a video and text your friends &ndash; especially if the alternative has got anything to do with something that happened like a gazillion years ago and is being promoted by your teacher and librarian as a fun lab activity with visiting researchers. Think about it. You were born the same year as <em>Google</em> and Zelda&rsquo;s<em>Ocarina of Time</em>. By the time you finished second grade, the world had downloaded over half a billion songs from <em>iTunes</em>, bought 42 million iPods, and witnessed the launch of <em>YouTube</em>. I mean, really: you <em>just</em> crossed the minimum age threshold to legally hold a <em>Facebook</em> account. Why would you even think to check out a history-based website &ndash; at school, no less &ndash; that required you to plough through three or four paragraphs about Benjamin Franklin, even if your teachers said it could be cool? &hellip;Especially if your teachers said it could be cool.</p>

	But that&rsquo;s exactly what we had, just 19 days before the launch of the first installment of our Alternate Reality Game (ARG), the <em>Arcane Gallery of Gadgetry (AGOG)</em>: a carefully crafted counterfactual history about the events leading up to the US Civil War, as well as the key roles played by the US Patent Office and the inventions housed within it. It was mid-March, and <em>AGOG &ldquo;Season 1&rdquo;</em> was slated for play during the first two weeks of April, by approximately 60 eighth graders. In early March, <a href=""http://www.impressionableplayers.com/?page_id=105"">Ann Fraistat</a>, <em>AGOG&rsquo;s</em> creative writer (and soon-to-be in-game protagonist), had deftly stitched most of the game&rsquo;s fictional strands into the weft of what we know today about antebellum America. To the rest of the <em>AGOG</em> design team, Ann had created a narrative replete with what transmedia author, J.C. Hutchins calls the &ldquo;<em>thrill, intrigue, frighten trifecta</em>:&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a> our mythology featured a philanthropic society torn in two by an ideological rift among its members, mysterious, recurring conflagrations and artifacts gone missing, and historical figures communicating across space and time to prevent reversals of past events that could cause potentially catastrophic changes in current events. But &ndash; how exactly might we feed its crisis and complexity to a bunch of 13 and 14 year olds? Note that during these same two weeks, our teen players would also be charged with choosing and completing training missions in navigation, scientific invention, archives, or cryptography, in order to become members of the secret society whose history we needed to convey &ndash; and whose survival they needed to care about. Arrrrggh.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<em>AGOG</em>is part of a larger study on the design and use of educational ARGs, and you can learn more about <em>AGOG</em> <a href=""http://www.arcanegalleryofgadgetry.org/season-1/"">hither</a>, <a href=""http://www.arcanegalleryofgadgetry.org/"">thither</a>, and <a href=""http://www.playthepast.org/?p=1888"">yon</a>(that is, if you&rsquo;re not an eighth grader preoccupied with teenage topics). Here, our middle-state story centers on the creation of April G., the <em>AGOG</em> in-game protagonist who became the primary mechanism by which our eighth grade players ingested and interacted with game&rsquo;s narrative. The middle-state artifact that I think represents April&rsquo;s story best is Ann&rsquo;s sketch, captured in the spiral-bound notebook she used to record her research. In happy hindsight, based on in-class chat messages, lab observation, and a post-game survey, we can report that April was not only the primary means for meting out the storyline; she was an engaging and effective one. However, it wasn&rsquo;t quite so clear to us on the Ides of March.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<img alt=""Description: Aprilfinal.png"" border=""0"" height=""402"" src=""file:///C:/Users/Amalia/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image004.jpg"" width=""585"" /></p>
<p style=""margin-left:2.0in;"">
	Figure 2: The sketch</p>
<p>
	One of the wonderful things about ARG design is that it mirrors ARG play: it hums along best when powered by &ldquo;<em>bunches of brains</em>.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a> So it was with <em>AGOG Season 1</em>. Any one of us might lob a question out to the group &ndash; mundane or mythic &ndash; and we&rsquo;d all brainstorm a bevy of ideas until we found what felt like the right response to that question. In the same way that players follow an ARG&rsquo;s narrative elements and collaborate across media, ARG designers brainstorm across multiple modes of communication.<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a> We shared ideas via email, texts, photographs, sketches, our design wiki, Google docs, Skype conversations, face-to-face meetings, and any number of mash-ups in-between.&nbsp; Would it be hyperbole for me to say that over the course of designing <em>AGOG</em> we had a veritable orgy of ideas, all arms and legs and heads and hearts thrown together in any number or form of rendezvous? Um, no. Admittedly, a scandalous image for the nineteenth century characters who were dragged into or borne out of our happy mess &ndash; but a fetching (and earnest) one, nonetheless.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	So that&rsquo;s what we did. We studied Ann&rsquo;s rich back-story that threatened to remain opaque to our teen players, and we brainstormed. Between March 14<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup>, on our design wiki and via emails, we weighed the pros and cons of presenting physical &ldquo;musty old tomes&rdquo; to the players, or graphic novel formats, or partially complete wiki entries, and of embedding more clues or videos into training missions. We looked at past ARGs (successful and not-so) and recalled how most of them feature in-game protagonists<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""">[4]</a> who discover their mythology in tandem with the players. JC Hutchins coined the phrase, &ldquo;<em>protagonist by proxy</em>&rdquo; to describe this interactive dynamic of ARGs, in which the player is presented with the same artifacts and information &ndash; such as URLs, copies of documents, photographs, email addresses, or phone numbers &ndash; as the in-game protagonist. Players have the chance to unearth secrets that the in-game character may not have but needs, and the in-game character has the means to communicate new information to the players. We had already conceived one present-day in-game character, Colette Gravure, the used bookstore owner who discovered one of the inventions from the <em>AGOG</em>, naively making public a centuries-old secret. Unfortunately, Colette was in her 60s &ndash; somewhere between the school librarian and Ben Franklin in terms of cool factor and age. But what if Colette had a niece or nephew who also stumbled upon the <em>AGOG</em> rabbit hole site? The new in-game protagonist should not be the same age as the middle school students, but definitely not &ldquo;too old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
	By March 19<sup>th</sup>, April Gravure &ndash; &ldquo;April G.&rdquo; to the players &ndash; was born. Her wiki page, describing her as &ldquo;<em>Collete Gravure&rsquo;s 21-year-old niece</em>,&rdquo; was posted and profile photos uploaded. On April 4<sup>th</sup>, a video of her taking the oath as a member of <em>JENIUS</em><a href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title="""">[5]</a>, an important <em>AGOG</em> secret society, was available to players, and by April 5<sup>th</sup>, over 50 of them had watched her first video blog to learn who she was and where to start. April G. also enabled us to iron out an end-game mechanism that we had puzzled over: how would we decide which player got to send the climactic message back in time? The players&rsquo; new end-game goal would be to ensure that April had all that was required for her to carry out the deed.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	If you examine Ann&rsquo;s notebook, you will find that there is only one reference to April G. &ndash; Ann&rsquo;s sketch (Figure 2). Ann also gave us copies of the notes she organized in a series of date-stamped Microsoft Word documents. In these notes, the first reference to April G. came on March 16<sup>th</sup> &ndash; and contained a half a page either derived from or relayed in our design emails that day:</p>
<p>
	<img alt=""Text Box: Protagonist by proxy:
-For the amount of mythology we need to impart, this seems like a good mechanism to me.
-Yes, I’m happy to act it, if you like. I also have an improv-trained background, so I’m comfortable interacting with players live if we want to do that via streaming, or even in person if that comes up.
-Can’t be Collette. To plausibly use Mildred Lewis Rutherford as a character, had to age Collette into her 60s. Could be her niece. I agree that the players would probably want someone closer to their own age, and to middle-schoolers, I think college seems like the height of coolness. How about a college student at UMD? If we wanted to, this would let us keep the same character when we adjust the game for college kids, too.
(Plus, there’s the added advantage of the fact that I probably pass for a college kid a little better than a high schooler… haha, at any rate, I hope… J)
-If this is what we’re doing, then maybe it makes sense this is the character who sends the 2011 message instead of a student? Easy way to justify her necessity to the plot.

<p>
	That&rsquo;s it. It was as if April G. had blossomed from Ann&rsquo;s head like Athena burst forth from Zeus&rsquo;s. Perhaps the rest of us on the team functioned in part like Metis, helping to plant the seed, or like Hephaestus, helping to draw it out. Regardless, from these deceptively simple musings, Ann developed a very real, humorous, simpatico character with whom all our teen players connected. Most wanted to help her, coax clues out of her, or simply chat with her. As April, Ann delivered the key to unlocking the story for our young players. By April 15<sup>th</sup>, less than a month after April sprang to life, Ann had crafted and delivered seven <a href=""http://www.arcanegalleryofgadgetry.org/time_files/slide0003.htm"">incredible video installments</a>to the players, and had their undivided attention. I can safely conclude that years from now, when budding transmedia designers study the &ldquo;protagonist by proxy&rdquo; technique, April G. will be one of the illustrious theogyny of in-game characters required for review. Before that, however, <em>AGOG</em> <em>Season 2</em> is coming soon, and April G. is waiting.</p>

	<strong>Democracy: A Work in Progress</strong></p>
<p>
	In 2011 we witnessed two extraordinary international people&rsquo;s movements: the Arab Spring and the Occupy movement. The Occupy movement followed the Arab Spring, and seemed to draw inspiration from it, to feel a certain affinity with it. The first day of the Occupation at St. Paul&rsquo;s, someone put up a mock London street sign with &lsquo;Tahrir Square&rsquo; written on it, expressing solidarity with protestors in Egypt.</p>
<p>
	But in what respect do these two movements resemble each other in their aims? To what extent can the Arab Spring and the Occupy movement be seen as <em>trying to do the same thing</em>?</p>
<p>
	The aims of the Arab Spring are clear: they want elections. The Arab Spring began in countries where leaders maintain power with force rather than votes, with protestors demanding the right to choose their own government.</p>
<p>
	The aims of the Occupy movement are less straightforward. It is clear what occupy is <em>against</em>: the movement is born out of a deep concern with global capitalism, at least in its present form. But what is the movement <em>for</em>? I participated in an early attempt at the St. Paul&rsquo;s Occupation to draw up demands. It wasn&rsquo;t easy. Some suggested demanding a tax on financial transactions; others objected that they didn&rsquo;t believe in finance. Some suggested global government; others the abolishing of government altogether. With such a diversity of convictions and concerns, consensus proved elusive.</p>
<p>
	However, there is one thing which in my experience all those involved in the Occupation sign up to, and that is <em>democracy</em>. If there is to be one positive goal which unities the Occupy movement, it must be the desire to bring about true democracy: rule by the people rather than the powerful.</p>
<p align=""center"">
	<strong>Counter-democratic forces</strong></p>
<p>
	This might seem strange. Isn&rsquo;t the Occupy movement taking place in countries which already have democracy? In UK and USA, you can go in a little booth every five years and tick the person you want to have power. Isn&rsquo;t that democracy?</p>
<p>
	Well yes and no. It would be over cynical to suggest that universal suffrage is not a significant achievement in the journey towards ideal democracy, and perhaps unfair to those who fought hard to get it. But it would be na&iuml;ve to think that the political system we have is anything more than a work in progress towards genuine democracy. There are significant counter-democratic forces operating, to a greater and lesser extent, in all &lsquo;democratic&rsquo; countries, which ensure that the powerful have undue influence in how society is shaped.</p>
<p>
	We can divide these non-democratic forces into two categories: <em>intra-national</em> and <em>trans-national</em>. The intra-national counter-democratic forces include corporate lobbying, funding of political parties by big business and the wealthy, and the selective information given out by major newspapers in the pursuit of their own political agenda. Democracy is about society being shaped by the people, where each person counts equally. But in all these ways the powerful few manage to have a weighty influence on governance.</p>
<p>
	But perhaps even more significant are the trans-national counter-democratic forces, and it is here that the aim of enhancing democracy connects with the Occupy movement&rsquo;s concerns regarding global capitalism. The defining contemporary problem is that (imperfect) democracy operates at a national level, whilst global capitalism operates at a global level. The power of an elected government to run the country as it pleases is severely constrained by the power of markets. Perhaps the most straightforward example of this is in the setting of tax rates. Countries are continually held to ransom by trans-national corporations threatening to leave should their tax obligations be increased. What is an appropriate level of corporate contribution to the public good should be decided by the people. Instead, to a large degree it is decided by trans-national corporations.</p>
<p align=""center"">
	<strong>How can we achieve democracy?</strong></p>
<p>
	In a sense then, we can see the Arab Spring and the Occupy movement as having the same goal: true democracy. Whilst the Arab Spring aims is trying to achieve the beginnings of democracy at a <em>national level</em> (by attaining free and fair elections), the Occupy movement is trying to perfect democracy within countries, and to attain it at a <em>global level</em>.</p>
<p>
	Despite this commonality of goal, there is an important difference in the two cases. It is (more or less) clear what the countries of the Arab Spring are seeking to achieve their goals; what they want (free and fair elections) already exists (more or less) in other countries. But the aims of Occupy lead us into uncharted territories. How can we counter the power wielded by the wealthy through political party funding and lobbying? How are we to protect the sources of truth from the pernicious distortions of certain elements of the media? Forming credible solutions to these difficulties requires thought, research, discussion, co-operation. These are the very things the Occupy movement is good at, but it&rsquo;s not an easy task.</p>
<p>
	Working out the way forward regarding global capitalism is even more challenging. If the essence of the difficulty is that (imperfect) democracy exists at a national level, whilst global capitalism operates at a global level, there seem logically to be two ways to right this wrong: we can either pull capitalism down from a global to a national level (or get rid of it altogether), or we can pull democracy up from a national to a global level. My preference, at least in the first instance, is the latter approach, which I will now spell out in more detail.</p>
<p align=""center"">
	<strong>Fiscal solidarity</strong></p>
<p>
	Global democracy need not entail global government, but perhaps a kind of &lsquo;fiscal solidarity&rsquo; between democratic communities. Marx taught us to conceive of the class war as between workers and capitalists. But we might think of the contemporary class war as between democratic communities and global capital. The &lsquo;collective dictator&rsquo; of global capitalism sustains power by pitting democratic communities against each other. As individual nations compete by lowering tax rates and cutting regulation in order to attract capital, more and more wealth is transferred from the 99% to the 1%.</p>
<p>
	Marx taught us that workers need to organise to break their chains. Similarly, democratic communities have everything to gain if they organise. If we co-operate rather than compete, we can slay the dragon of tax competition by ensuring that global capital has nowhere to run to (which may ultimately involve refusing to trade with &lsquo;scab&rsquo; nations). If the citizens of the world could choose how to tax big business, finance and the wealthy, free from the need to be &lsquo;competitive&rsquo;, then we might finally begin to redistribute wealth back from the 1% to the 99%. The days of not having enough to provide the highest standards of health, education and public services to all would be confined to history. Furthermore, equality at a global level could be regulated, by allowing developing countries the tax advantages currently afforded to Switzerland and the Cayman Islands.</p>
<p>
	At the present time, this level of global co-operation seems not to be a realistic option, not least because national democracy is in each country either imperfect or non-existent. But what I have sketched above is an ideal, which could be worked towards in stages. The establishment of a Robin Hood Tax on financial transactions would be an important first step. Once people see how much they have to gain from getting a grip on global capitalism, they may be inspired to go further.</p>
<p>
	This is an ideological battle. Nobody talks about &lsquo;trickle down&rsquo; any more. The new myth to persuade the 99% to act and vote against their interests is the fear of &lsquo;big government&rsquo;. What the economic right don&rsquo;t tell you is that freedom for capital and freedom for the people are diametrically opposed.</p>
<p align=""center"">
	<strong>The next stage</strong></p>
<p>
	The Occupy movement should see it self as a movement for democracy which aims at enhancing democracy within democratic communities, and reclaiming for democratic communities the power lost to global capitalism. How this is to be done is far from obvious. I have given outlined above one proposal, and encourage others to do the same. It&rsquo;s not going to be easy, but if the Occupy movement is to continue to grow as an effective force for political change, it must begin the hard job of working out the details of how to bring about true democracy.</p>

Anyone can be an ally; trot out Warren Buffett or George Soros. Postmodernism has dedicated itself to rooting out all forms of thought that exclude, denounce, or express moral certitude, worrying (understandably) about where such judgments might land and who might get scapegoated, remembering the fate of Robespierre, himself a Professor of a Revolution who helped create the machine that murdered him. Postmodernists pine for a theory, a language, a politics that won&#39;t turn on itself and cannot be coopted, and they think this will come by refusing to condemn, exhort, or name names. The problem is, of course, that this is another form of absolutism, and it is often delivered with moral certitude. And no theory can solve all of the potential pitfalls of a movement by simply hewing to the correct meta-form. Political strategies can only be corrected in the same place they arise: in the street.</span></p>

These are the billionaires, and billionaireses, whose wealth and power is beyond our imagination.

	<em>&ldquo;Without music, life would be an error.&rdquo; &ndash;Friedrich Nietzsche, </em>Twilight of the Idols</p>
<p>
	Of all of the charges lobbed at the Occupy Movement&mdash;they are privileged, overeducated, lazy, greedy, leaderless, prescriptionless, immature, filthy, idealistic, dangerous, anarchical, <em>etc</em>.&mdash;none is more curious than what is said of its music.</p>
<p>
	George Will diminished the drum circles in Liberty Plaza as liberal nostalgia and a &ldquo;facet of the Sixties.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1"" title="""">[1]</a> In response to Alan Grayson, former Democratic Congressman from Florida, and his explanation of OWS, on <em>Real Time with Bill Maher</em>, PJ O&rsquo;Rourke quipped, &ldquo;Get the man a bongo drum; they&rsquo;ve found their spokesman!&rdquo; And in an early piece about the Movement, Andrew Grossman at the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>couldn&rsquo;t help but mention the most common injury among Occupiers: blisters from bongo drums.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn2"" name=""_ednref2"" title="""">[2]</a></p>
<p>
	What&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>
	Perhaps the opponents have read their Plato and what he says about how corruptible music can be to the soul&mdash;and to the city. In Book II of Plato&rsquo;s <em>Republic</em>, Socrates posits that a smaller and simpler city is to be preferred to one that is large and disharmonious. In fact, our desire for non-essential things&mdash;Glaucon calls it &ldquo;relishes&rdquo;&mdash;is the cause of war, as cities look to expand their territory to accommodate them. Hence what was once a &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; city soon comes to include &ldquo;all the hunters and imitators, many concerned with figures and colors, many with music; and poets and their helpers, rhapsodes, actors, choral dancers, contractors, and craftsmen of all sorts of equipment.&rdquo; The simple and true city is becomes &ldquo;a bulky mass of things.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn3"" name=""_ednref3"" title="""">[3]</a></p>
<p>
	If material want is the origin of war, then it&rsquo;s also the origin of government; for it creates a need for leaders, or guardians. And we&rsquo;ll also need an education proper to the city. It is a physical education, in the gymnasium; but it&rsquo;s also a musical one. Yet the music can&rsquo;t be of just any kind; it too needs to be consistent with the needs of a just and well-ordered city. That requires the censorship and even compulsion of the poets, story tellers, and musicians. They must tell tales that are correct in form and substance&mdash;&ldquo;songs written in the panharmonic mode and with all rhythms,&rdquo; as Socrates explains.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn4"" name=""_ednref4"" title="""">[4]</a> Put another, less liberal, way, &ldquo;There must be no innovation in gymnastic and music contrary to the established order&hellip;For never are the ways of music moved without the greatest political laws being moved.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn5"" name=""_ednref5"" title="""">[5]</a></p>
<p>
	And we can&rsquo;t forget that Plato was no great fan of democracy. Sure, he calls it a fair and sweet regime that makes possible all sorts of lives, but it&rsquo;s also an unjust regime that&rsquo;s one step away from tyranny, when people misuse their liberty.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn6"" name=""_ednref6"" title="""">[6]</a> In other words, count Plato out of the drum circles.</p>
<p>
	Nietzsche too understood the power of music. Unlike Plato, whose main goal seemed to be ensuring only suitable works would be produced for the sake of preserving the city, Nietzsche saw, at least at first, music in general as a transformative influence, one that could return German culture, and even Western civilization, to its historic heights. The full title of his first significant work (from 1872) was <em>The Birth of Tragedy from of the Spirit of Music</em>. There he writes of how, &ldquo;In song and in dance man expresses himself as a member of a higher community.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn7"" name=""_ednref7"" title="""">[7]</a></p>
<p>
	On hearing Wagner for the first time, Nietzsche wrote: &ldquo;for the life of me I cannot preserve an attitude of cool criticism in listening to this music; every nerve in my being is set tingling.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn8"" name=""_ednref8"" title="""">[8]</a> In the &ldquo;Attempt at Self-criticism&rdquo; added to later versions of <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em>, Nietzsche commented on how &ldquo;art, and <em>not</em> morality, is presented as the truly <em>metaphysical</em> activity of man.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn9"" name=""_ednref9"" title="""">[9]</a> And in the Epilogue he wrote:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&quot;In its measure of strength every age also possessed a measure for what virtues are permitted and forbidden to it. Either it has the virtues of <em>ascending</em> life: then it will resist from the profoundest depths the virtues of declining life. Or the age itself represents declining life: then it also requires the virtues of decline, then it hates everything that justifies itself solely out of abundance, out of the overflowing riches of strength.&quot;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn10"" name=""_ednref10"" title="""">[10]</a></p>
<p>
	But Nietzsche would eventually turn on his teacher and friend&mdash;after Wagner debuted his too-Christian <em>Parsifal</em>. &ldquo;Wagner is merely one of my sicknesses,&rdquo; he would later remark.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn11"" name=""_ednref11"" title="""">[11]</a> Nietzsche&rsquo;s break with Wagner signaled a revaluation of art and culture. This explains why Apollo becomes secondary in Nietzsche&rsquo;s later writings: he came to understand more clearly that culture could only be set right through a tragic philosophy, a Dionysian philosopher. Music in general, and Wagner in particular, was no longer the answer. Art must be driven by philosophy, not the other way around. And in any event, neither was to serve mass democracy.</p>
<p>
	Allan Bloom, author of <em>The Closing of the American Mind</em>, was certainly a close reader of these philosophers. &ldquo;Plato&rsquo;s teaching about music is, put simply, that rhythm and melody, accompanied by dance, are barbarous expressions of the soul,&rdquo; he writes. &ldquo;It is not only not reasonable, it is hostile to reason.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn12"" name=""_ednref12"" title="""">[12]</a> Bloom hoped that a proper liberal (by which he meant conventionally moral) education would moderate our natural passions and desires; that was the stuff civilizations were made of. &ldquo;To Plato and Nietzsche,&rdquo; Bloom observes, &ldquo;the history of music is a series of attempts to give form and beauty to the dark, chaotic, premonitory forces in the soul&mdash;to make them serve a higher purpose, an ideal, to give man&rsquo;s duties a fullness.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn13"" name=""_ednref13"" title="""">[13]</a></p>
<p>
	And it&rsquo;s not just that music will affect that soul; it&rsquo;s what that corrupted soul will do&mdash;namely, want to have sex.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn14"" name=""_ednref14"" title="""">[14]</a> &ldquo;Rock music has one appeal only, a barbaric appeal, to sexual desire&mdash;not love, not <em>eros</em>, but sexual desire undeveloped and untutored,&rdquo; chides Bloom.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn15"" name=""_ednref15"" title="""">[15]</a> It&rsquo;s not so much that music will have a direct or immediate effect, but that it will affect the ability to young people to receive a proper education.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn16"" name=""_ednref16"" title="""">[16]</a></p>
<p>
	Bloom sounds a little dated&mdash;and just a little closed minded&mdash;and not just for his attack on those crazy kids and their &ldquo;rock music.&rdquo; Even so, it&rsquo;s more than just rock and roll he should be worried about. As Ambrose Leung and Cheryl Kier have concluded in an article from <em>Journal of Youth Studies</em>, not all music subverts equally; indeed, classical, opera, musicals, world music, new age, house, heavy metal, punk, ska, and even easy listening (?!) all are associated with more politically active listeners. (It turns out, somewhat surprisingly, that hip hop, rap, R&amp;B, and pop have a negative association with activism.)<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn17"" name=""_ednref17"" title="""">[17]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;What kind of music do we see at OWS? And to what extent is it corrupting souls, risking civilizations, and making people horny?</p>
<p>
	I took a group of students to New York in October, in conjunction with The City, a class I taught in the Fall of 2011. The students were interested in seeing the Occupy protestors, so, after a relatively dull tour around Times Square, we went to where the real action was.</p>
<p>
	There were drummers drumming and dancers dancing, and there were even nappers napping. But mostly the music seemed incidental to what everyone was doing&mdash;which was just trying to live and draw attention to the issues of the Movement.</p>
<p>
	Seeing such dedication made me want to do something. I&rsquo;m probably too old and way too soft to sleep outside, I too quickly surmised, but I wanted to <em>do something.</em> I don&rsquo;t know that I agree with everything associated with the Movement (or if they agree with themselves), but they are drawing attention to important issues related to social mobility, economic inequalities, and corporate responsibility. Plus, if nothing else, I can&rsquo;t help but worry about my students&mdash;their preparedness, their professional prospects, their chance at a purposeful and happy life. And what kind of world are they heading in to?</p>
<p>
	It was inspiring to see so many young people stand up for what they believe in. After spending years hammering that message home in my courses, I couldn&rsquo;t help but want to participate in some way. I decided I wanted to go down there and play some songs for them.</p>
<p>
	I spent the next few weeks putting together a list of appropriate songs and memorizing lyrics (mostly in my car). I enlisted a former bandmate of mine, Christian Laursen, who I knew would be sympathetic to the Movement. He liked the name I came up with for us to play under: Golden Shower Parachutes.</p>
<p>
	After a one-off run through and a two-week illness-related delay, we ended up there on a Saturday in November. It was sunny and crisp and very crowded. Apart from the people who were camped out, there were countless locals and tourists who were down there just to check out the scene.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to play some songs,&rdquo; I said to the woman at the Information Desk, who, more than anyone else, looked like she might be in charge&mdash;or at least in the know. &ldquo;Where should we set up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Wherever you like,&rdquo; she somewhat laughingly responded.</p>
<p>
	A little after 1:00, we jumped up on a marble foundation on the corner of Broadway and Liberty and kicked into Bob Dylan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tombstone Blues.&rdquo; It was windy and loud, and I could barely hear myself play or sing. Out of necessity, our guitar strumming became a bit more deliberate, and I had to sing louder. A few people stopped, some slowed down, but mostly people kept walking. It wasn&rsquo;t the immediate revolution that I had anticipated, but at least we were joining in the fun. We didn&rsquo;t have an order to what we were planning on doing, so we played it by ear, as it were, and quickly went through songs by Rage Against the Machine, Billy Bragg, and the White Stripes.</p>
<p>
	There&rsquo;s nothing like the look on someone&rsquo;s face when they&rsquo;re walking by and recognize a song you&rsquo;re playing. (That happened a lot when we played Arcade Fire&rsquo;s &ldquo;City With No Children.&rdquo;) It&rsquo;s instant community.</p>
<p>
	In addition to the walkers-by, some would stop and watch and even sing along. I even got a handful of young people to play our tambourine and the shakers I brought.</p>
<p>
	Around mid-performance, someone came up and requested an original song and videotaped our performance. We played a song (&ldquo;Get Love&rdquo;) that I wrote about the Movement. It was the first time I had ever played the song for anyone.</p>
<p>
	After we went through our set, we started just strumming chords and singing the words on the signs that people held up as they walked by. Everyone loved to have their signs sung back to them. Then we did our set again for a new crowd.</p>
<p>
	Countless people wanted pictures of us or us and them, and at some point, I was approached by a documentarian, who wanted me to sing the Arabic word for freedom. After she told me how to pronounce it (<em>hurriyya</em>), I started singing it over of a chord progression we had been playing, and Christian joined in with some harmonies. She was thrilled. &ldquo;You just made our documentary,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to put it at the very end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The highlight of the afternoon was when we played (John Lennon&rsquo;s) &ldquo;Power to the People.&rdquo; During the second chorus, I glanced to my right, and saw this elderly woman&mdash;she must have been in her mid- to late-60s&mdash;holding up her fist and singing with me. I&rsquo;ll never forget it.</p>
<p>
	There was more than music and more than politics going on that day, in my mind at least. To drive that point home, my friend and roommate, Brendan Murphy, came down to meet us that day&mdash;to see us play and to support the Occupiers. While he was walking around, he saw a sign asking for shower facilities. We ended up having two guys (Kent and Johnny) from California come up to our apartment in Astoria. They used our shower&mdash;they hadn&rsquo;t had a shower in a week or so&mdash;we made them tea, which eventually become dinner, and gave them some clothes. (They lost a good bit of their stuff after the raid, which happened earlier that week.) We offered to let them sleep on our floor, but they wanted to be with their friends, so they ended up heading off to&mdash;I think&mdash;a church in Manhattan.</p>
<p>
	Music might not have been central to what was going on that day. But it was for me, and its ability to bring people together can&rsquo;t be discounted.</p>
<p>
	Clearly, Plato, Nietzsche, and Bloom are not the philosophers for the Occupy Movement. They might be radicals, but they are the wrong kind of radicals.</p>
<p>
	But Theodor Adorno&rsquo;s critique of music has something to offer us. &ldquo;The role of music in the social process is exclusively that of a commodity,&rdquo; he laments; &ldquo;its value is that determined by the market. Music no longer serves direct needs nor benefits from direct application, but rather adjusts to the pressures of the exchange of abstract units.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn18"" name=""_ednref18"" title="""">[18]</a></p>
<p>
	Inspired by Adorno, Michael Bull, in his <em>Sound Moves</em>, has found that iPod technology might have made the workplace more pleasurable (in that you can chose to replace the music or noise of the office or factory with something of your own choosing), but it hasn&rsquo;t made it any more communal. We merely use our choice of music to work more efficiently.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn19"" name=""_ednref19"" title="""">[19]</a> Nevertheless, &ldquo;we cannot close our ears to the world,&rdquo; he concludes; &ldquo;and it is this very openness that constitutes their democratic nature.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn20"" name=""_ednref20"" title="""">[20]</a> In a piece coauthored with Les Black, Bull puts it rather succinctly, &ldquo;Sound connects us in ways that vision does not.&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn21"" name=""_ednref21"" title="""">[21]</a></p>
<p>
	Commercial music and the individualized technology that has come to play it have resulted in a &ldquo;mediated we-ness&rdquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s Adorno, again. Rather than having music bring us together, we are using it to keep us apart. Or maybe the philosopher John Coltrane said it best: &ldquo;the audience heard &lsquo;we&rsquo; everywhere the singer said &lsquo;I.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn22"" name=""_ednref22"" title="""">[22]</a></p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;s not only the easy commodification that&rsquo;s at work here. It&rsquo;s also a question of the active versus the passive. In <em>This is Your Brain on Music</em>, Daniel J. Levitin writes:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	&quot;Whenever humans come together for any reason: music is there&hellip;Only relatively recently in our culture, five hundred years ago or so, did a distinction arise that cut society in two, forming separate classes of music performers and music listeners. Throughout most of the world and for most of human history, music making was as natural an activity as breathing and walking, and <em>everyone participated</em>.&quot;<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn23"" name=""_ednref23"" title="""">[23]</a></p>
<p>
	If passive consumption is the problem, then non-commercialized participation is the solution.</p>
<p>
	And it&rsquo;s not just the playing; it&rsquo;s the playing together. Others, including Alfred Schutz and Peter J. Martin have treated the reciprocal nature of collective music making as a kind of dialogue between the Other&mdash;a &ldquo;mutual tuning-in relationship,&rdquo; as Schutz puts it.<a href=""file:///C:/Users/michelss/Documents/Michels%20Occupy%20Thought.docx#_edn24"" name=""_ednref24"" title="""">[24]</a></p>
<p>
	In any event, it seems clear that opponents of OWS are not objecting to the music because it&rsquo;s silly or pointless; they&rsquo;re deeply suspicious of it because it&rsquo;s evidence that the Movement has real traction. Whether it&rsquo;s a full-on drum circle or just two friends with borrowed songs looking to make a difference, the people might actually have the power.</p>
<p>
	But to say that music is powerful is to actually diminish what it can do. Music does not convey or transfer power: it transcends it.</p>

From the automobile to the television, all the goods selected by the spectacular system are also its weapons for a constant reinforcement of the conditions of isolation of &lsquo;lonely crowds.&rsquo;&rdquo;<em>Society of the Spectacle</em> (Black and Red, 1977), 26.</p>

	<strong>The Gilded Age and Great Depression</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; that followed The Civil War was characterized by westward expansion combined with a massive industrial extension made possible by new technologies like the gasoline engine and the increased mechanization of industries such as steel, textiles, farming and mining.&nbsp; During &lsquo;The Gilded Age,&rsquo; names that Americans still celebrate as folk heroes such as Carnegie, Mellon, Morgan, Rockefeller and Vanderbilt amassed fortunes on a scale never thought possible by taking advantage of these new economic opportunities.&nbsp; However, there is a controversial side to many of these men mostly forgotten to history.&nbsp; When Americans celebrate Gilded Age elites as exemplars of American Individualism, we often forget in their own time they were called <em>robber barons.&nbsp; </em>This derogatory phrase refers to the ways many industrialists maintained an aristocratic-like status in society through amoral and often illegal business practices that allowed their fortunes to grow at the expense of the greater social good.&nbsp; In fact, Mark Twain named this period &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; to metaphorically describe how these few, immensely successful individuals and their opulent lifestyle as gilding our society, or as putting a thin layer of gold over an object to conceal the ugliness beneath. &nbsp;Just beneath the golden surface of &lsquo;The Gilded Age,&rsquo; most workers suffered in poverty despite working inordinate numbers of hours at difficult and often dangerous industrial or agricultural jobs.&nbsp; In fact, exploitation of these workers is a larger reason why robber barons were able to amass vast fortunes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inequalities beneath the surface of &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; fa&ccedil;ade resulted in economic and political practices that concentrated not just wealth but also power in the hands of robber barons.&nbsp; Political corruption was widespread during &lsquo;The Gilded Age,&rsquo; which enabled robber barons to both rig economic rules to their favor or avoid culpability for their behaviors that went beyond moral and crossed legal lines.&nbsp; A famous and fitting example considering Twain&rsquo;s gilding metaphor occurred when the railroad baron Jay Gould used his political connections to create inflation by manipulating the availability of gold, which then forced commodity traders to import goods like wheat from western markets to increase supply&mdash;commodities that had to be moved at inordinate rates on Gould&rsquo;s trains.&nbsp; While the Grant administration ultimately foiled the plan, Gould&rsquo;s manipulations were the root cause of the Black Friday stock market crash of 1869.&nbsp; Because of his political connections, Gould was never charged with any crime.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn10"" name=""_ednref10"" title="""">[10]</a></sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn10"" name=""_ednref10"" title=""""></a>&nbsp; Practices like this were quite common as robber barons drew upon their power and oligopolistic control over the economy to maximize their gains in ways that often came at the expense of less powerful others and the economy as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there was some progressive pushback in the early 1900s, and we generally ignored inequalities during &lsquo;The First Great War&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Roaring 20s,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; not only lasted until the late 1920s, but the inequalities and corrosive economic practices of the age largely caused &lsquo;The Great Depression.&rsquo;&nbsp; Following World War I, an increasing amount of capital flooded the investment market from small investors, many of whom bought &ldquo;on margin&rdquo; or borrowed the money to invest in the market in the hopes that return rates would outpace interest payments.&nbsp; Financiers then used others&rsquo; borrowed capital to enhance their own investments by taking advantage of the inflated prices that came from over demand.&nbsp; But on Black Thursday in 1929, it was suddenly apparent the inflated value of stocks could no longer be maintained and the stock market crashed.&nbsp; The subsequent run on the banks meant even those who did not gamble on Wall Street lost their savings alongside the investors when their many banks shut their doors.&nbsp; Businesses large and small collapsed from a lack of consumer demand, and overall lack of both capital and credit for investment meant stagnation persisted.&nbsp; The effects of the subsequent depression were widespread, which meant loss and suffering were distributed across the social classes, as often those who had the most at the end of &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; lost the most.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>The New Gilded Age and Great Recession</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting in the 1980s, the &lsquo;Trickle-Down&rsquo; economics of the Reagan administration began to make America look more and more like &lsquo;The Gilded Age.&rsquo;<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn11"" name=""_ednref11"" title="""">[11]</a></sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn11"" name=""_ednref11"" title=""""></a>&nbsp;The bull markets of the 1990s and the policies of both Bush administrations shifted capital from the working and middle class to the capitalist class.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn12"" name=""_ednref12"" title="""">[</a></sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn12"" name=""_ednref12"" title=""""></a><sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn12"" name=""_ednref12"" title="""">12]</a>,<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn13"" name=""_ednref13"" title="""">[13]</a>&nbsp;</sup> Half way into the first decade of this century, economists, including Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman, pointed out how America was in the midst of a &lsquo;New Gilded Age&rsquo; because income, wealth and power were increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small group of elites at levels not seen since the days of the robber barons.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn14"" name=""_ednref14"" title=""""><sup>[14]</sup></a>&nbsp; But so long as the fa&ccedil;ade of shared prosperity was maintained with over-valued stocks, rising equity in real estate, and enhanced lifestyles made possible by both low cost goods and easily available,<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn15"" name=""_ednref15"" title=""""><sup>[15]</sup></a>a highly regulated discourse meant any talk of inequality and the consolidation of political power in the capitalist class was considered un-American.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn16"" name=""_ednref16"" title=""""><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were a great many historical parallels between the dawn of the 21<sup>st</sup> century and &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; we ignored much to our peril.&nbsp; Both gilded ages followed protracted periods of war which, when ended, opened up new markets.&nbsp; The end of The Civil War was followed by massive westward expansion that stalled even before the outbreak of fighting because of political stagnation.&nbsp; Similarly, the fall of the Soviet Union in 1992 had the same effect of the fall of the U.S. Confederacy as the end of open hostilities opened up markets all across the globe.&nbsp; Furthermore, just like the technologies developed during the Civil War propelled production across many peacetime industries, the computer technologies developed during the Cold War were unleashed by the fall of Communism and made globalization happen at both an astonishing rate and on a scale never thought possible.&nbsp; Similar to the first Gilded Age, expanding markets and new technologies provided increasing opportunities for entrepreneurs to introduce new products and amass great fortunes.&nbsp; &nbsp;The financial industry was quick to capitalize both on technology to improve communications and trade so they could take full advantage of these entrepreneurs&rsquo; innovations.&nbsp; Also like the first Gilded Age elites used their wealth and power to both game the system, many in the financial sector compelled politicians to undo regulations put in place after the 1929 Wall Street crash and to avoid punishment for their amoral and sometimes illegal market practices.&nbsp; Furthermore, just as in 1929, an inflated and over-leveraged market quickly and abruptly corrected itself and there was a massive drop in the markets that began on September 29<sup>th</sup> of 2008.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at this point the historical trajectory diverges and the times become distinct from one another.&nbsp; In 1929, the very same laissez-faire policies of the Hoover administration that allowed problematic trading practices and an expansion of inequalities meant the state allowed the invisible hand of the market to correct itself with detrimental costs.&nbsp; This is not what happened in 2008, as free-marketers pressured the federal government to institute their actual economic belief; profits should be privatized, while losses should be socialized.&nbsp; In 2008, the new robber barons or &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; used their power and forced the passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act that saved large banks and the companies that insured them; although it should be noted these &ldquo;banks&rdquo; are better described as investment houses because they do little to safeguard money for individuals in their pursuit of profit through the markets.&nbsp; However, calling them banks reinforces the narrative that what we faced as a nation was another great depression, thus &lsquo;the banks&rsquo; were saved because history taught us The Hoover administration&rsquo;s failure to act quickly in 1929 further entrenched economic stagnation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, even though both market crashes in our history were followed by periods of economic recession and stagnation, &ldquo;The (Investment) Bank Bailout&rdquo; as it is now called is one of many economic policies that vastly altered the unfolding of supposedly free market practices.&nbsp; In his 2010 State of the Union Address, President Obama proudly declared&hellip;</p>
<p class=""rteindent1"">
	One year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by a severe recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, and a government deeply in debt.&nbsp; Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act, we might face a second depression.&nbsp; So we acted -&ndash; immediately and aggressively.&nbsp; And one year later, the worst of the storm has passed.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn17"" name=""_ednref17"" title="""">[17]</a></sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn17"" name=""_ednref17"" title=""""></a></p>
<p>
	Technically, this statement is likely correct as &lsquo;The (Investment) Bank Bailout&rsquo; did likely stave off further economic turmoil that could have stagnated economic growth for decades that characterized &lsquo;The Great Depression.&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, what is left unsaid in these remarks is that in staving off depression, this and other policies like &lsquo;The Stimulus Plan&rsquo; that primarily consisted of tax breaks for corporations; the federal government continued &lsquo;The New Gilded Age.&rsquo;&nbsp; By essentially allowing the new robber barons to embezzle tax dollars with no strings attached, the federal government perpetuated Gilded Age economic practices and made the different social classes experience the downturn in vastly different ways.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn18"" name=""_ednref18"" title="""">[18]</a></sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn18"" name=""_ednref18"" title=""""></a>&nbsp; The 99% lost a large proportion of their investments and continues to suffer from the economic downturn.&nbsp; While there was very brief talk of the super-rich&rsquo;s demise with the start of the downturn, since then &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; has fared quite well through &lsquo;The Great Recession.&rsquo;<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn19"" name=""_ednref19"" title="""">[19]</a>,<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn20"" name=""_ednref20"" title="""">[20]</a></sup>&nbsp;While technically most individuals (e.g. upwards of 99%) are suffering as they did during &lsquo;The Great Depression,&rsquo; in terms of inequality we have never put &lsquo;The New Gilded Age&rsquo; behind us because an elite few continue to prosper in ways that are historically unprecedented.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn21"" name=""_ednref21"" title=""""><sup>[21]</sup></a><sup>&nbsp; </sup>However, so long as a vast majority of citizens presume there is widespread economic hardship as there was in during &lsquo;The Great Depression,&rsquo; the prosperity of &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; that is occurring at the expense of &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo; goes mostly unnoticed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Resuming the New Gilded Age</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States never really moved away from &lsquo;The New Gilded Age&rsquo; as inequality persists despite the great deal of turmoil in the investment markets right before the elections of 2008.&nbsp; Yet, the turmoil itself did instill a narrative that our own economic time is similar to &lsquo;The Great Depression&rsquo; given the memories of the 1929 stock market crash that affected everyone.&nbsp; Yet in 1929, the crash often meant those who had the most were the ones who lost the most while, in our own time, policies like &lsquo;The (Investment) Bank Bailout&rsquo; redirected history and, despite popular misconceptions about widespread suffering at the top of the class hierarchy, those who had and have the least are now suffering the most.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn22"" name=""_ednref22"" title="""">[22]</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</sup></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the risk of morbidity, a simple example illustrates the divergence between these two periods.&nbsp;&nbsp; We likely heard stories about Wall Street bankers throwing themselves from buildings during the 1929 crash and subsequent depression; this type of death was even used as the just end to the villain in the movie Titanic, one of the highest grossing films of all time.&nbsp; While perhaps more folklore than fact, there are not even rumors of this happening in the 2008 crash and subsequent recession; and why would stories like this emerge given that Wall Street investors are doing better than ever?<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn23"" name=""_ednref23"" title="""">[23]</a>&nbsp;</sup> Instead we read about Chinese workers at an Apple electronic factory installing nets to catch suicide jumpers while we posthumously celebrate Steve Jobs as the quintessential industrialist or technologist of our own Gilded Age.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn24"" name=""_ednref24"" title="""">[24]</a>,<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn25"" name=""_ednref25"" title="""">[25]</a></sup></p>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, much like the first gilded age where robber barons felt confident to do as they please without consequences, today &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; can both metaphorically and literally consider themselves above the law.&nbsp; The arrogance of &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; as indicated by things like their disregard of public opinion as they write themselves record high bonuses while they lay off workers is indicative of their confidence they can continue to block investigations into their wrongdoings.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn29"" name=""_ednref29"" title="""">[29]</a>&nbsp;</sup>Instead, they watch the police arrest occupiers in nighttime commando raids from opulent offices and apartments in their ivory towers above.&nbsp; And of course evicting people from these public spaces, many of whom turned to occupy camps because they had no place left to go, in no way resemble the &lsquo;Hooverville&rsquo; shanty-towns that became the symbols of &lsquo;The Great Depression.&rsquo;&nbsp; Rather, these raids remind us of &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; when robber barons, safe in their Victorian Mansions, would pay state and private militias like the Pinkertons to throw workers out of company-owned houses and violently break up peaceful strikes with egregious over-uses of force.&nbsp;</p>

	<strong>Consequences of Seeing the New Gilded Age as the Great Recession&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We tend to live in reality as we see it, not as it actually is,<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn30"" name=""_ednref30"" title="""">[30]</a></sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn30"" name=""_ednref30"" title=""""></a>and thus there are important consequences when we misconstrue our contemporary economic reality with &lsquo;The Great Depression.&rsquo;&nbsp; One peculiar aspect about our retrospective assessment of &lsquo;The Great Depression&rsquo; is how the period is now often looked at with a certain degree of nostalgia, or as one of the great triumphs of our society.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn31"" name=""_ednref31"" title="""">[31]</a></sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn31"" name=""_ednref31"" title=""""></a>&nbsp; For example, there is a framing how prior to winning &lsquo;The Second Great War,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Greatest Generation&rsquo; used their tenacity, ingenuity and fortitude to first survive and then overcome &lsquo;The Great Depression.&rsquo;<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn32"" name=""_ednref32"" title="""">[32]</a>&nbsp;</sup> Thus, we tend to overlook the widespread suffering and political turmoil of this time and instead focus on how a country first survived and then overcame &lsquo;The Great Depression&rsquo; by first sacrificing and then pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we compare our own time to &lsquo;The Great Depression,&rsquo; it makes us think there is a great deal of suffering amongst all the social classes, while also reinforcing arguments the way to overcome our economic challenges is to work harder than we ever have before while sacrificing everything we can do without.&nbsp; Of course, suffering is not evenly distributed across the classes as &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo; bear the brunt of our hardships while &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; continues to prosper.&nbsp; Furthermore, &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; are doing so well in large part because &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo; devote themselves to working harder and harder for the greater social good.&nbsp; Many Americans are now more educated (often at great financial cost to ourselves) and productive than ever; yet wages have been stagnant for a generation and are now actually starting to decline, especially when we factor in inflation and increased costs of living.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn33"" name=""_ednref33"" title="""">[33]</a>&nbsp;</sup> Thus, under a guise of shared struggle, &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; uses the promise of better times ahead to convince &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo; what is needed now is for us to sacrifice everything we do not need and to work harder and harder for less income that increasingly provides a lower and lower standard of living.<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn34"" name=""_ednref34"" title="""">[34]</a>,<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn35"" name=""_ednref35"" title="""">[35]</a>,<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn36"" name=""_ednref36"" title="""">[36]</a></sup>&nbsp; Of course, these practices are much more akin to &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; where workers were all but forced by gunpoint to toil for low wages than &lsquo;The Great Depression&rsquo; where economic stagnation existed because individuals could not find jobs and could not contribute to the greater social good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also important to recognize that, similar to &lsquo;The Great Depression,&rsquo; blame for the economic crisis is falsely spread away from Gilded Age economic elites and toward victims of circumstance.&nbsp; History textbooks emphasize how &lsquo;small investors buying on margin&rsquo; were a major cause of the 1929 stock market crash.&nbsp; While widespread borrowing to invest was a problem, it occurred primarily because those in the financial industry knew they could make money without risking their own capital.&nbsp; This created a situation where financiers could gamble in a game with only two outcomes; &ldquo;tails they win, heads we lose.&rdquo;&nbsp; Today, &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; is already rewriting recent history to read in a similar way.<sup>[<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn37"" name=""_ednref37"" title="""">37]</a></sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn37"" name=""_ednref37"" title=""""></a>&nbsp; Turn on any business cable news channel or pick up the Wall Street Journal and inevitably you will find arguments that ignore the reckless investments of elites and instead blames 99%ers for taking on the very same levels of debt they encouraged for the better part of a generation. <sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn38"" name=""_ednref38"" title="""">[38]</a></sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn38"" name=""_ednref38"" title=""""></a>&nbsp; For example, &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; blames &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo; for over-using their credit cards to buy frivolous lifestyle items, although investigations show a significant portion of the debts owed come from fees and inordinate interest rates charged by lenders.{<sup><a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn39"" name=""_ednref39"" title="""">39]</a>&nbsp;</sup> Since the 2008 crisis was primarily a result of the mortgage morass, it is also common for The 1% to argue homeowners irresponsibly bought homes they could not afford, thus essentially calling The 99% too stupid to understand the risks they undertook despite overwhelming evidence realtors steered their customers towards homes they could not afford to heighten their commission while mortgage providers carelessly, if not intentionally, overlooked mistakes in applications&mdash;likely because they knew the mortgage would be sold to investors who would take the loss if the loans defaulted.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn40"" name=""_ednref40"" title="""">[40]</a>&nbsp; Defying logic, &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; still hold fast to these arguments while continuing to oppose the Consumer Protection Bureau<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn41"" name=""_ednref41"" title="""">[41]</a>even though it might help stop the supposedly &lsquo;consumer stupidity&rsquo; they argue caused the 2008 crash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; have a vested interest in convincing the country we are fighting off another great depression rather than recognizing we are living in a second gilded age.&nbsp; While it would be impossible to ever establish this framing of our socio-economic conditions is a concerted effort by &lsquo;The 1%,&rsquo; there are obviously benefits when the majority of &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo;are unaware how similar our time is to one of the most egregiously exploitative periods in our history.&nbsp; This is because there would be a great deal more resistance to the status quo and a desire for change when we properly recognize the economic organization and problems we confront are much more similar to &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; than &lsquo;The Great Depression.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Fighting the Wrong Battles</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part of living in the reality we see as opposed to recognizing reality as it actually exists means our efforts are often directed at the issues we see as problematic as opposed to seeking solutions to the troubles that actually ail us.&nbsp; In short, because we do not recognize the problems we face today are more akin to what the United States confronted during The Gilded Age, our efforts to combat economic recession and stagnation are doomed to fail because the actual problems we face as a nation stem from inequality.&nbsp; Specifically, the primary issues confronting the United States are the concentration of wealth of &lsquo;The 1%,&rsquo; which according to zero-sum economic theories is only possible during slow economic growth when it comes at the expense of &lsquo;The 99%.&rsquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thus, because we incorrectly perceive the socio-economic organization of today akin to &lsquo;The Great Depression,&rsquo; we tend to draw upon a select subset of New Deal policies and programs FDR used to overcome the first great economic stagnation our country faced that had inherently different root causes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was brief talk of action on inequality immediately after the 2008 presidential election, but this was more fiction than fact as Obama&rsquo;s first two signature pieces of legislation did more for &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; than &lsquo;The 99%.&rsquo;&nbsp; The stimulus package consisted primarily of tax cuts to benefit businesses.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn42"" name=""_ednref42"" title="""">[42]</a>&nbsp; While Obama&rsquo;s health care reform bill does include rules that make patients less vulnerable to their insurance companies, it mostly funnels capital into for-profit, publically traded corporations because it does not contain the public option he campaigned on.&nbsp; Furthermore, inequality was quickly abandoned as a rationale for these efforts, as even the health care legislation was supported with arguments that it would be good for the economy&mdash;a framing that served to further reinforce perceptions we are stuck in another great depression as oppose to a second gilded age.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The election of a Republican congress in 2010 meant even talk of inequalities were dismissed as &lsquo;class warfare.&rsquo;&nbsp; The 112<sup>th</sup> congress focused the political discussion almost exclusively on government spending, often by comparing our own time to &lsquo;The Great Depression&rsquo; to instill a sense that sacrifices needed to be made.&nbsp; By insisting the government had a &ldquo;spending&rdquo; problem as opposed to a &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; problem, a crusade was launched against&nbsp; New Deal and Great Society programs like Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and Food Stamps that alleviate inequality.&nbsp; Forms of corporate welfare and military spending that benefit primarily &lsquo;The1%&rsquo; were not a part of the discussion.&nbsp; Furthermore, arguments about a more progressive tax code were quickly shut down as &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; argued taking anything away from the &lsquo;job creators&rsquo; would stall the very recovery &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; argue was not happening because of government spending.&nbsp; Thus, by perceiving the economic climate as similar to &lsquo;The Great Depression&rsquo; rather than coming to understand it more closely resembling &lsquo;The Gilded Age,&rsquo; we largely overlooked how The 1% continued to prosper at historically unprecedented levels while we asked the poorest in the nation to give up their food and medicine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often, discussions about &ldquo;reigning in government spending&rdquo; were framed as necessary because of the country&rsquo;s growing debt that would hinder economic recovery and indebt future generations.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one instance where comparisons back to &lsquo;The Great Depression&rsquo; were not useful, as history tells us the Depression was severely hindered when New Deal programs were cut back in 1933.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn43"" name=""_ednref43"" title="""">[43]</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;Still, these arguments were only plausible because while we did not compare our time back to &lsquo;The Great Recession,&rsquo; in argument about government spending, we still failed to recognize that, much like &lsquo;The Gilded Age,&rsquo; government debt was perpetuating inequality.&nbsp; While wars and increasing health care costs played a role in putting the United States deep into the red, the single biggest reasons for our debts are tax cuts that began with the &lsquo;Trickle-Down&rsquo; economic policies of Reagan and then exponentially increased during the administration of George W. Bush&mdash;although the latter president framed tax cuts as &lsquo;across the board&rsquo; even though they benefitted primarily &lsquo;The 1%.&rsquo;&nbsp; However, by framing the cuts as if they benefit everyone, it is much less likely the tax reform would be recognized for what it is: a policy essentially straight from &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; given that an elite few manipulated the state for their elite interests.&nbsp; Furthermore, if we would somehow recognize that right now the economic climate is more comparable to &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; than &lsquo;The Great Depression,&rsquo; all discussion of government debt would likely cease as we would also likely recognize household debt is much more problematic because too many households are paying off old bills rather than making the new purchases that drive a consumer-based economy like ours.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn44"" name=""_ednref44"" title="""">[44]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More recently, both candidates and office holders focus their attention on public statements on unemployment, and they often make these proposals by noting unemployment is, and has been, at sustained heights not seen since the Great Depression.&nbsp; While this is likely in some part due to upcoming elections, and running on jobs is a platform few voters could ever disagree with, it is also likely due in large part because we think of our time as akin to &lsquo;The Great Recession.&rsquo; This leads to the conclusion the biggest issue our country faces is unemployment.&nbsp; Of course, even with comparisons of the contemporary jobs crisis to &lsquo;The Great Depression,&rsquo; this has not compelled any politician to seriously consider action on the scale of FDRs massive job programs even though our infrastructure is outdated and even crumbling.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn45"" name=""_ednref45"" title="""">[45]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, while the talk of fixing unemployment is mostly just that, it does reinforce the misconstruing of own gilded age with &lsquo;The Great Depression.&rsquo;&nbsp; While unemployment is both high, and we should never underestimate the personal consequences of not working for any period of time,<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn46"" name=""_ednref46"" title="""">[46]</a><sup>,<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn47"" name=""_ednref47"" title="""">[47]</a></sup>we should also accept that the historically low wages of our &lsquo;Gilded Age&rsquo; means lower unemployment is not going to fix the actual problem we face in the United States: inequality (which is of course at historically high levels in large part because wages are historically so low).<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn48"" name=""_ednref48"" title="""">[48]</a>&nbsp; Under these &lsquo;New Gilded Age&rsquo; conditions, we could miraculously achieve full employment; yet if those jobs do not pay a living wage, a vast majority of &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo; will still have a lifestyle as if they were living during a second great depression.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn49"" name=""_ednref49"" title="""">[49]</a><sup>,<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn50"" name=""_ednref50"" title="""">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>
	<strong>Comparing Today&rsquo;s Economy to the Gilded Age Era</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An example is useful to highlight how today&rsquo;s economy is much more comparable to &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; than &lsquo;The Great Depression.&rsquo;&nbsp; Growing up in the remnants of an Appalachian coal mining town, even our elementary school teachers lectured us about the gruesome lessons of &lsquo;The Gilded Age.&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Classes often focused not only on strikes and deadly accidents, but I also learned about the regular business practices at the mines which ensured companies maintained almost total control over labor in order to exploit workers any and every which way they could.&nbsp; In addition to keeping wages low by busting unions and reducing solidarity by exploiting racial and ethnic divides between workers, companies also controlled workers by paying them in currency only redeemable at company owned outlets. I spent the early years of my life in a company-owned house that was once owned by a mine and rented out by miners.&nbsp; My grandfather would send me to get the mail at the post office right next to the old company store that once overcharged workers so they would be perpetually indebted.&nbsp; If workers did somehow garner a wage increase, rent and food prices would simply rise proportionally so owners could maintain the profits and thereby continue to expand their fortunes.&nbsp; Their power over the political process at all levels ensured either the system was unlikely to change in ways that would undermine their profits or benefit the workers.&nbsp; The power of these robber barons also ensured elites were never held accountable when they crossed legal lines.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today&rsquo;s labor and compensation practices seem much more akin to &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; described above than &lsquo;The Great Depression&rsquo; as the entire economic system is designed so the few can benefit from the hard work of the many regardless of how the economy performs. Consider a typical person&rsquo;s career and lifestyle.&nbsp; Most now begin careers by pursuing a college degree, which is often accomplished by securing student loans from large banks subsided by tax dollars.&nbsp; Increasingly, those tax dollars are redirected away from colleges and universities themselves, which increase the costs of education to the benefit of the large banks who increasingly provide larger and larger loans.&nbsp; At the same time, universities and colleges are pressured to reduce costs which often come at the expense of the educations they can provide because of larger classes, outdated technology, and instructors who are less available because they teach more sections of larger classes with outdated technology.&nbsp; Thus, students are increasingly borrowing more and more for educations that are of a lesser quality, and this occurs because the system is designed not to educate but to direct resources towards large banks and the financial sector under the guise of providing educations.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn51"" name=""_ednref51"" title="""">[51]</a>&nbsp; Many students even now pay to work for free through unpaid internships.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn52"" name=""_ednref52"" title="""">[52]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully these indebted students will graduate and secure employment, although statistics show that jobs will be at historically low wages even though that new employee will likely produce at historically high levels&mdash;in large part because of the educational investments they made in themselves.&nbsp; Those low wages will be justified with arguments that the global labor market is competitive, and those arguments might be partially true for &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo; of workers in a corporation; &lsquo;The 1%s are of course in a position to benefit from the global race to the bottom.&nbsp; For global corporations that are increasingly employing a larger and larger proportion of the workforce as they force smaller operations to go out of business, corporate officers are positioned to take advantage of historically low wages by padding their own salary with profits gained because of increasingly exploited labor across the globe.&nbsp; Of course, &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo; are told to ignore corporate profits and instead focus on how lower production costs benefits consumers with lower prices.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn53"" name=""_ednref53"" title="""">[53]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, with the decline of small businesses, it is increasingly likely that worker will be employed by a publically traded company.&nbsp; The employee is thus likely to work harder and harder not for bonuses or raises but under the threat of unemployment.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn54"" name=""_ednref54"" title="""">[54]</a>&nbsp; This means they are essentially working against themselves, as their increased productivity will benefit primarily the financial sector that hedges their bets that workers will work harder and harder for less and less&mdash;all the while they seek out workers in the far reaches of the world who are willing to work for less and less.&nbsp; That employee is also likely to pay more and more for their health care, while insurance companies and their investors earn more and more by reducing the quantity and quality of care that the worker receives.&nbsp;&nbsp; With pensions pretty much relegated to history, that employee is also likely to invest in a individual retirement plan like a 401k, which provides capital for the financial industry invest for their own gain while providing a legitimate outlet to direct losses.&nbsp; This worker may also choose to take on a mortgage, which is increasingly likely to come from a large bank, thus ensuring even more of their capital is redirected to financial sector.&nbsp; In fact, the mortgage itself may be securitized and sold back to the worker through their retirement account.&nbsp; Thus, many workers are actually paying on their mortgage twice, which means the financial industry will benefit from the payments while the worker loses investment capital with falling home prices.<a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/node/add/contributed-pieces?destination=contribute#_edn55"" name=""_ednref55"" title="""">[55]</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the worker is technically paying their mortgage in triplicate, because their tax dollars are also likely going to subsidize the same financial sector that exploits the worker through their consumption.&nbsp; This is likely the case unless the worker makes so little they become part of &lsquo;The 47%&rsquo; who do not make enough to pay federal taxes, as the costs of student loan interest, mortgage interest, medical bills, and the deductions for any children this worker might have negate their federal liability.&nbsp; Thus, whereas Wall Street financiers are not only taxed at a lower rate because they make money from investments, they will also get to write-out the full costs of their second mortgages while the regular worker may not make enough to take full advantage of the deductions and write-offs the tax system instituted in days gone by to promote the economic development of &lsquo;The 99%.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these practices that essentially shift capital away from &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo; and toward &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; are much more similar to what we witnessed during &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; than &lsquo;The Great Depression.&rsquo;&nbsp; While the processes are inherently more complex and illusive than the more straightforward 19<sup>th</sup> century practices where you worked for an employer only to hand back your paycheck in the form of rent and company store credit, the end result of redirecting capital upward through exploitative practices is exactly the same.&nbsp; However, the illusive operation of our larger economic system is concealed as we compare current economic conditions to &lsquo;The Great Depression&rsquo; instead of recognizing that much like &lsquo;The New Gilded Age&rsquo; economy work exactly as elites designed it to do; or it is only working for &lsquo;The 1%&rsquo; who have the power to manipulate every, if not all aspects of the economy for their gain that comes at the expense of &lsquo;The 99%&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We study history because knowing where we have been is often an excellent way to understand where we are, and where we are likely to go&mdash;or in some cases, to avoid where we are heading.&nbsp; Yet, the power of retrospection can also be used to guise our reality; or to make us think we are somewhere quite apart from our actual existence.&nbsp; This is the case of contemporary socio-economic context as we tend to think of ourselves either immersed in or during the early stages of recovery from a second &lsquo;Great Depression.&rsquo;&nbsp; While there are a few historic parallels between today and the early 1930s, evidence suggests comparisons to &lsquo;The Gilded Age&rsquo; would be much more appropriate because the political and economic systems operate in ways that benefit a small group who sit atop the socio-economic at the expense of the vast majority.&nbsp; Thus, if we are to use history to guide us toward a better time that benefits everyone as opposed to a select few, we need to recognize our reality for what it is:&lsquo;The New Gilded Age.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>

	Game and &quot;virtual&quot; worlds are artifacts.&nbsp; If you know where to look, you can search inside these &quot;synthetic&quot; worlds (Castronova) and the software that constructs them to find traces of their makers&#39; abandoned plans and future projects.&nbsp; Access to the process of creating such a world is related perhaps to the digging of an archaeologist or spelunking of a cave-crawler.&nbsp; It is a process of exploring hidden spaces that reveal their earlier, incomplete or abandoned states, including areas that are not meant to be seen because they are still under construction.&nbsp; How might we curate the incomplete spaces and models created by human programmers, designers and artists, as well as the work of their explorers?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	One idea about searching for the &quot;hidden archive&quot; of a virtual world would lead to materials collected for its construction, from art assets to source code. This documentation is naturally of historical interest and could be considered as materials gathered or created by the &quot;authors&quot; of a virtual world that are not generally accessible by other parties. They are, in a sense, the unpublished notes and drafts of the creators of software-based worlds.&nbsp; This take aligns with Dan Cohen&#39;s description of scholarly hidden archives as &quot;the secondary products of scholarship: the bibliographies, notes, personal finding aids, and assessments by scholars of which items are important and unimportant in an archive.&quot;&nbsp; (Cohen, &ldquo;Interchange&rdquo;) The eerily parallel situations would make for an interesting comparison. However, I have something else in mind.</p>
<p>
	Instead of focusing on the architects, this essay is about the diggers and spelunkers who uncover hidden artifacts and archives of virtual worlds. It is also about the documentation they create and disseminate.&nbsp; I am interested in their efforts not just to find hidden spaces, but to reveal what they found through screenshots, machinima, and other forms of communication.&nbsp; The world in question is Blizzard Entertainment&#39;s <em>World of Warcraft (WoW)</em>, and its archeologists and cave-crawlers were a small, mysterious group known as the Nogg-aholics.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Unlike most groups in massively-multiplayer games like <em>WoW,</em> the Nogg-aholics were not primarily organized as an in-game guild, but rather as a &quot;community&quot; of <em>WoW</em> players called the Nogg-aholic Collaboration (NAC).&nbsp;&nbsp; During their halcyon days, from 7 Jan. 2006 to 7. Jan 2007, they gathered instead around an information resource, the Nogg-aholic Forum, and a collaborative machinima project, &quot;My Burning Valentine.&quot; Led by prominent <em>WoW</em> explorers such as Dopefish, Malu05 and Snoman, this group of players applied their &quot;leet skills&quot; to &quot;explore the unexplored,&quot; a motto affixed to many screenshots of hidden areas in the game credited to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&lt;put image 1 here&gt;</p>
<p>
	The skills required to explore hidden areas in WoW and reveal them creatively to the player community can be divided into two main categories: exploration and documentation. The first category includes abilities that enable players to get around the virtual world and discover places that are normally difficult to reach. At the time the Nogg-aholics were active<em>, WoW</em> included numerous areas that were still under construction or inaccessible without the use of player tricks or knowledge of software glitches in the game.&nbsp; Efforts to investigate these places owed a debt to common practices in digital game culture such as glitching and Easter egg hunting.&nbsp; Many classic console games included hidden areas, going back to the first &quot;Easter egg,&quot; a hidden room and message in Atari&#39;s <em>Adventure</em> (1979).&nbsp; Even without secret rewards, adventure, role-playing and many other game genres require extensive exploration, and players often documented what they found with maps and screenshots. Indeed, Dopefish&#39;s moniker paid homage to an object, the Dopefish, that was hidden (and discovered by players) in dozens of games as a tribute to its original appearance in the Commander Keen game, <em>Secret of the Oracle</em> (1991).&nbsp; While easter eggs are created intentionally by programmers, many games also contain bugs or &quot;glitches&quot; that produce unanticipated game artifacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As James Newman has pointed out, a glitch such as the &quot;Minus World&quot; in the original version of Nintendo&#39;s <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. (1985) became &quot;a morsel to be found and savoured by the expert gamer.&quot;&nbsp; (Newman 113) Easter eggs, glitches and other revealed artifacts of game worlds have become part of the shared cultures of digital games.</p>
<p>
	The Nogg-aholics primarily used three techniques to reach <em>WoW&#39;s</em> hidden areas: exploits (understood in the broadest sense to include unorthodox, but legal player skills), private servers, and analysis of <em>WoW</em> data files.&nbsp; Their exploits included tricks such as &quot;instance switching&quot; and &quot;wall-walking.&quot; Wall-walking, for example, enabled players to exploit glitches in the game physics to reach areas that were not supposed to be accessible during 2006, such as Hyjal or &quot;Developer&#39;s Island.&quot; They returned with screenshots and videos as proof of their discoveries and thus built an archive of hidden spaces for viewing and speculative commentary by other players.&nbsp; Private servers emulated the official Blizzard server software.&nbsp; Players on a private server enjoyed unrestricted access to every feature of the game, including equipment, abilities and areas that were unavailable on Blizzard&#39;s official servers. It was hardly surprising that authoring, hosting or using the <em>WoW</em> client on a private server was (and is) a violation of the game&#39;s End User License Agreement (EULA).&nbsp; Using private servers, while not a common practice of the Nogg-aholics, nevertheless added to the maverick reputation of the group and sharpened the edge of potential disagreements with Blizzard about their activities.&nbsp; Finally, by early 2006 as the Nogg-aholics were launching their on-line forum, new tools such as John (Darjk) Steele&rsquo;s WoW Model Viewer opened up the game&rsquo;s model database to their curious gaze.&nbsp; The Model Viewer and a similar tool called the Map Viewer read files stored in Blizzard&#39;s MPQ (for &quot;Mike O&#39;Brien Pack&quot; or Mo&#39;PaQ) format, giving players direct access to every level map, character and equipment model, particle effect, animationor other game asset in the game, including metadata. &nbsp;Initially, players used the viewer in order to view character animations or inspect items they had little chance of ever seeing as in-game loot.&nbsp; Before long, machinima creators realized that they could create videos by compositing models and maps, editing these elements, and even mixing them with live in-game performance to make movies.&nbsp; The Nogg-aholics, including several who were expert in machinima production, used these tools to reveal places and items that were not available in the current version of the game, either because they had been dropped from development or were essentially place-holders for future implementation.</p>
<p>
	&lt;put image 2 here&gt;</p>
<p>
	The link between exploration and machinima production leads to the tactics deployed by the Nogg-aholics to reveal the abandoned and hidden artifacts of <em>WoW,</em> as well those &quot;in draft&quot; or under construction.&nbsp; Machinima -- moviemaking based on game environments and engines -- was a key tool.&nbsp; Indeed, &quot;My Burning Valentine&quot; was the project that prompted the public roll-out of the Nogg-aholics and their on-line forum.&nbsp; Machinima creators do not just use digital games as a production technology. They work inside game spaces and software to scout locations, and to build or find sets, artwork, and animation, as well. These skills emphasize abilities beyond cinematography, such as exploration and finding places that are special either for their visual qualities or their meaning to an audience consisting primarily of players. By 2006, <em>WoW </em>movies had become an essential part of the game&rsquo;s culture as it grew in popularity. Moreover, the adoption of techniques such as editing models or creating new animations for them, based on discovery through the Model Viewer, occurred just as the Nogg-aholics project took off early in 2006. For example, Deeprun Goldwin Michler&#39;s &quot;The Man Who Can&rdquo; (2006), depicted a character who joyfully escapes the limitations imposed by Blizzard&#39;s pixels with new moves animated by Michler.&nbsp; Machinima projects such as Tristan Pope&rsquo;s &ldquo;Switcher&rdquo; series (2005-2006), Jason Choi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Edge of Remorse&rdquo; (2006), and Mike Spiff Booth&#39;s &quot;Code Monkey&quot; (2006) all utilized model/map discovery, manipulation, and compositing. The leading edge of model editors included Dopefish and Snoman, both prominent among the Nogg-aholics, and others who were influenced by them, such as Baron Soosdon (then known as Soosisti).</p>
<p>
	We can imagine the <em>World of Warcraft&#39;</em>s hidden archives by considering examples of three categories of middle-state artifacts exposed or created by the Nogg-aholics, ranging from those created (and barred) by Blizzard to those made by the players: inaccessible areas, documentary machinima, and re-imagined places.</p>
<p>
	On 3 Jan. 2006, Blizzard released WoW patch 1.90, which eliminated the abilities to &quot;walk on steep terrain&quot; or &quot;move slowly through some locked doors and gates.&quot; The patch was the first of several to constrain wall-walking as a means for exploration of certain areas.&nbsp; A few days later, #Nogg-aholic, the forum created by the Nogg-aholics, was founded. The first major <em>WoW</em> expansion, <em>The Burning Crusade,</em> was released a year later on 16 January 2007, about a week after it was &quot;decided to close down the nogg-aholic community.&quot;&nbsp; During the year between these events, the Nogg-aholics operated in the settings of the &quot;classic&quot; <em>World of </em>Warcraft at the top of their game, while Blizzard worked steadily towards the release of new content in the expansion. The game world was essentially a work-in-progress. &nbsp;The player community was intensely curious about new locations under construction.&nbsp; The level of tension between the Nogg-aholics efforts to reveal and Blizzard&#39;s to conceal steadily increased.&nbsp; An example of a hidden region not yet released to players was Mount Hyjal, an important location in <em>Warcraft</em> lore eventually opened as part of the Caverns of Time in <em>The Burning Crusade.</em>&nbsp; During the year before its release, the Nogg-aholics frequently cliffwalked into Hyjal, finding construction signs and taking screenshots of Archimonde&#39;s skeleton hanging from the World Tree. They released the images in a lengthy blog post in February of 2006 on the &quot;lack of content updates&quot; in <em>WoW.</em>&nbsp; As early as October 2005, Dopefish and Forg had released &quot;Nogg-aholic: The Movie,&quot; which included a short passage through the area around the World Tree.&nbsp; Several months later, a Hyjal walkthrough featuring Nogg-aholic screenshots and other documents, such as a &quot;pictorial guide&quot; with screenshots, posts from forums, and videos, could be found&nbsp; at &quot;Lost WoW: An Explorer&#39;s Guide.&quot; The editors of this website noted that &ldquo;since it is &lsquo;just a game,&rsquo; the world&#39;s &lsquo;history&rsquo; is lost with each patch.&rdquo; Mindful of this loss, they dedicated their work &ldquo;to the exploration of the game world, especially hidden areas and secrets, as well as its historical preservation.&quot;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Lost Wow&rdquo;) Blizzard tried to restrain explorers from reaching hidden locations such as Hyjal ahead of their expansion&rsquo;s completion. Caydiem, the game&#39;s community manager, wrote in a forum post that &quot;these places were not meant to be accessed by players.&quot;&nbsp; Wall-walking itself was &quot;an exploit, as it&#39;s doing something that goes against the proper game mechanics &hellip;&quot;&nbsp; In a later post Caydiem complained that, &quot;I apparently can&#39;t stress this enough<em>: the developers never meant for you to get these areas.&quot; </em>The official Blizzard discussion thread in which these posts appeared is no longer available on-line; the document survives only because Caydiem&#39;s response was preserved by a screenshot saved at the Nogg-aholics&#39; website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&lt;put image 3 here&gt;</p>
<p>
	The Nogg-aholics thus specialized in an activity that can be described as a combination of spelunking, exploration, excavation and archiving in terms appropriate for a digital environment: searching out and documenting unfinished or generally inaccessible locations in <em>World of Warcraft.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; As explorers, the guild members ventured into spaces that Blizzard as developer of the game was not ready to release to its players, such as the upcoming expansion areas for<em>The Burning Crusade.&nbsp; </em>Machinima videos created by members such as Dopefish documented what they found, seeking to provide information to the player community about these spaces.&nbsp; As one commentator later put it, these and other <em>WoW</em> explorers tried to &ldquo;document everything that was suddenly new and uncertain&rdquo; about the game world. (Howgego &ldquo;Exploration&rdquo;) A good example of the care with which the Nogg-aholics documented changes to the game world, as well as their own capacity to explore it, is given by Dopefish&#39;s documentary machinima piece, &quot;Last Wallwalk: The Movie&quot; (April 2006). Dopefish archived the movie, with a collection of screenshots and an image of Caydiem&#39;s comments about wall-walking (see above), at the Warcraft Movies website (warcraftmovies.com). They document &quot;the Last Wallwalk event that was held 02/01/2006,&quot; the day before the <em>WoW</em> patch that &quot;nerfed&quot; (disabled) wall walking.&nbsp; The inclusion of Caydiem&#39;s negative comments underscored the adversarial relationship between the Nogg-aholic&#39;s role as explorers and historians of the world and Blizzard&#39;s control of the game. Screenshots showed the efforts of Game Managers (GMs) to prevent the excursion and revealed the suspension of a participant&rsquo;s account for &quot;extreme violation of terrain and disruption of roleplay.&quot;&nbsp; The machinima video tracked dozens of players blitzing through several areas of the game world--often by wall walking--and the futile efforts of GMs to control them along the way, until at last they are all disconnected from the game server and their accounts suspended. Many of the more than 400 comments on the Warcraft Movies website about the movie nostalgically recalled not just places and practices shown in &ldquo;The Last Wallwalk,&rdquo; but memories of watching the Dopefish&#39;s machinima documentary, their window into otherwise inaccessible content.</p>
<p>
	&lt;put image 4 here&gt;</p>
<p>
	Dopefish is probably best remembered for two machinima documentaries he completed in 2005, &quot;Exploration: The Movie&quot; and its aforementioned sequel, &quot;Nogg-aholic: The Movie.&quot;&nbsp; Both movies are no longer available via the Warcraft Movies website, &quot;due to a Blizzard request. It violates their Unreleased Content policy.&quot; (&ldquo;Exploration: The Movie&rdquo;) These machinima projects were both products of Nogg-aholic efforts to document inaccessible spaces and undocumented locations found by able explorers.&nbsp; As we have seen, disagreements with Blizzard about their practices, legal tangles around the <em>WoW&rsquo;</em>s user licenses, and the developer&#39;s updates to the game code combined by 2007 to erode the Nogg-aholics&#39; ability to document and preserve evidence of hidden locations of the world.&nbsp; The impact of their projects continued in the form of new machinima practices that evolved out of access to game artifacts such as models and maps in ways pioneered by the explorers. After the closing of the Nogg-aholics forum, works such as Snoman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wandering Dreamscape&rdquo; and Baron Soosdon&rsquo;s &ldquo;I&rsquo;m So Sick,&rdquo; both issued later in 2007, exploited access to these game assets as a new technique for making <em>WoW-</em>basedvideos.&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp; Snoman made &ldquo;Wandering Dreamscape,&rdquo; the first in a series of Dreamscape pieces, as a &ldquo;tribute to the Nogg-aholic community&rdquo; and its primary video creator, Tobias &ldquo;Dopefish&rdquo; Lundmark.</p>
<p>
	Snoman&rsquo;s tribute to the Nogg-aholic community leveraged intimate knowledge of game assets and how to manipulate and modify them to construct an &ldquo;alternate <em>Warcraft.&rdquo; </em>&nbsp;He made an explicit point of using machinima to show &ldquo;what is possible when you have the tools and proper knowledge of the <em>WoW</em> data.&rdquo; (Snoman 2007)&nbsp; &ldquo;Wandering Dreamscape,&rdquo; for example, deployed over a dozen model changes to transform landscapes into alternate virtual realities. These changes were made possible by expert use of the Model Viewer, FRAPS-based video capture, composited elements from other areas in the game world, and Baron Soosdon&rsquo;s landscape model editing. The end result was a complete re-imaging and re-imagining of <em>the WoW</em> region known as The Barrens.&nbsp; Snoman&#39;s fictional reworking of this virtual game world as the &ldquo;Barrens Biohazard&quot; documented something else, as well: How exploring, revealing hidden elements of a game world, documentation, and game data could be controlled by the player, not the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	The image above is a digital surrogate from a pre-press original for the cover of <em>Fantastic Four </em>55 (Marvel Comics, October 1966), with pencil artwork by Jack Kirby and inked by Joe Sinnott. The letterer is unknown. Please note how the handmade cut-and-paste layout design work was applied on top of the original penciled and inked artwork. This document reveals the layers of manual craftmanship involved in the creative and reproduction process; paper, ink, glue, and xerox copying traceable as the textual markers that would be flattened out in the process of mechanical reproduction to result in the final form of colour printing. This image is a survivor of an industrial creative and production process that assumed the pre-press original&#39;s functional nature, a mere means to an end: the printed publication. It is a fact that a look back at the past of comic books is always clouded in the smoke of furnaces (Hajdu 2009). Gravett and Stanbury (2006) have lamented the way the history of comics has been determined by the history of their destruction:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:28.35pt;"">
	Sniff the air once again [&hellip;] and you&rsquo;ll detect another whiff strongly associated with British comics: the telltale smell of burning paper and artboard turning to ashes. Seen merely as another stage in the production process by many publishers, pages of original artwork would be used by them to prop up a wobbly table, mop up a spillage or be casually disposed of to save time and expense. One employee can still chuckle to himself at the memory of his consigning most of the artwork from [a] weekly comic into a flaming brazier&quot; (Gravett and Stanbury 2006:6).</p>
<p>
	The comics scholar therefore faces the hurdles imposed by a lack of systematised, browsable archives, which in many cases means the inability to work directly with the source material. Many comics publications have completely disappeared, making thorough critical engagements with the comics form more difficult. The scarcity of historical primary sources can be also explained by the very history of the comics form, its material conditions of production and its particular place within print culture.&nbsp; The &quot;original&quot; in mainstream superhero comics of this era was always a collective and collaborative effort, and the artwork&#39;s whole purpose was to be reproduced as a monthly or bi-weekly stapled publication printed in colour. The production process of American mainstream comic books implied an industrialised process that constrained artistic expression within strict guidelines and the quick delivery of the work to the reader, as a result of censorship and market demands. The high costs of production became another obstacle, due to the number of active participants in the process whose wages had to be paid from the books&#39; sales. In comparison, the &quot;underground&quot; model of production would offer a simpler process, reinstating the authorial role of the artist and writer that had been lost in the transition from the age of the newspaper comic strip at the end of the 19th century to the dawn of the comic book in the late 1930s.</p>
<p>
	The underground comics revolution of the late 1960s and early 70s, like the subsequent mini-comics movement of the 1990s, involved the author directly in the design, reproduction (photocopying), binding, distributing and selling of his/her creation. As was the case for the medieval scribe, the underground comic artist made use of a scriptorium that was not only limited to the actual drawing and writing of the graphic story, but also to the physical production of the publication itself. The late 1960s allowed underground comics to move into the realm of self-publishing thanks to the technological evolutions in photomechanical reproduction. Developments in photocopying technology allowed artists to produce originals in larger or smaller sizes that would later be amplified or reduced in the Xerox machine. Pre-press mechanical originals of the covers and title pages were composed in a combination of manual and xeroxed processes, and often the panel illustrations integrated handmade drawings with photocopying, photomontage and collage techniques, as practiced for example by Jack Kirby (1917- 1994) in the United States and Alberto Breccia in Argentina (1919-1993), which would influence a younger generation of artists such as Bill Sienkiewicz (1958-) and Dave McKean (1963-).</p>
<p>
	Until that moment, comic books had always been printed in the cheapest way possible, and large runs on high-speed offset presses were typically beyond the access of most artists. But access to mimeograph machines and electrostatic photocopying was simple and affordable, and soon technological limitations became expressive possibilities. The purple-blue duplicator ink of the mimeograph or the high-contrast, ashy toner ink of the Xerox machine are not just incidental details, but stylistic, aesthetic devices that defined, amongst other things, a political position and an artistic, literary genre. The technologies available to comic book creators, always embedded in a network of relations organised by the demands of a market that included other products of print culture (newspapers, magazines, cereal boxes, posters, record sleeves), defined the form (story) and format (type of publication) of the comics they created. Any change in format, technology or culture invariably transformed the comics text. Superhero comics and &#39;comix&#39; had in common an awareness of thie inherently technological (mechanical) nature of reproduction in connection to the unseen manual processes involved in the creation of pre-press original pages.</p>
<p>
	Walter Benjamin wrote of &quot;the decay of the aura&quot; of the original artwork when it was mechanically reproduced. This is amplified and at the same time deconstructed in comic book culture. For Benjamin the &quot;aura&quot; or the original work of art existing only in one unique period of time and place only emanated from works that had not been devalued through mechanical reproduction, the original was always-already the finished product, the final article. Paradoxically, reproduction re-canonised the aura of the original: the more an original was reproduced and distributed, the more one wanted to see <em>the one</em>. But the &quot;original&quot; artwork in comics was not seen as an end itself but as another necessary step before it achieved its ultimate end: mechanical reproduction, printing. Therefore the comic art original was always-already devoid of aura, even to its creators, who often did not seen them as items of value. If archives and collections of printed periodical comic books are still rare and largely destined to be incomplete due to the sheer amount of published material, systematic collections of pre-press originals are even harder to find; the pre-press original is a middle-state document by definition, a literal mock-up that remained hidden, deleted, burned out from the finished product and the readerly experience. In days in which the digital composition of comic art pages is widespread and taken for granted, pre-press originals like Jack Kirby&#39;s survive as incredibly valuable historical and aesthetic &quot;documents of barbarism&quot;. They are revealing long-gone pieces of the jigsaw puzzle of comic book collective creativity and artistry, the embodiment of the text as a tangible surface where history is inscribed and embossed as layers of pencil, ink, Tipp-Ex (Wite-Out) paper and glue.&nbsp;</p>

	These drawings represent the design progession of a game that the Human-Computer Interaction Lab&#39;s Intergeneration Design Team, Kidsteam, created in response to the challenge of helping children be more environmentally friendly at home, school, or while visiting the White House. The game is called Energy House and has been well received by those who have played it. A video of the gameplay can be found at http://youtu.be/DCmFeNawUS4 . Although the game is fun, I am more fond of the design process we followed than what was generated.</p>
<p>
	Kidsteam is based on the idea that children should be partners in the design of new technologies for children (Druin). In order to do this, we use various techniques to co-design these new technologies. Energy House was designed through a technique we call Layered Elaboration (Walsh et al.). I really like layered elaboration because it enables designers to build on other designers&rsquo; ideas through the use of transparent overlays or old-fashioned overhead transparencies. In short, one designer (or team) creates a design on paper, then a transparent overlay is applied, the design is given to another team who adds to the design on the transparent overlay.</p>
<p>
	We used this technique with three groups. I&rsquo;ve attached the progression of designs that the group made for helping children be more green at school. The first drawing shows the school that contains a robot and books about being more environmentally friendly. The next image shows litter with an X over it indicating that it is bad and, in the lower left corner, it has a green playground that generates electricity. The final group added a tree that displays how green you are acting&mdash;the more green you are, the more alive the tree is, but, if you act unfriendly towards the environment, the tree begins to lose leaves and withers.</p>
<p>
	That part of the story can be read in extreme detail in the previously mentioned paper on Layered Elaboration. The part that I&rsquo;m excited to talk about is the next steps towards the final proto</p>
<p>
	The idea of generating your own electricity through play was really cool. Based on discussions with the other adult Kidsteam members, I looked into attaching devices that generate electricity to things like a pogo stick. Fortunately, I have no archivable materials showing me on a pogo stick. I quickly realized that the technology would need to be screen based in order to realize the designs of the group. At this point, I shelved the idea of generating electricity.</p>
<p>
	My next prototype was to be a game that utilized the tree feedback idea. The game would allow players to build a house and the tree would let them know if they were being green or not. I only ended up making the screenshot above because I looked up from my desk and saw a USB dance pad in my home office. Our family had ordered it as a free promotion from a food company who wanted to encourage kids to move as part of the game. When we received it in the mail, we found out the online games it was designed for only worked with PCs and we had Macs. From then on, it really didn&rsquo;t get used.</p>
<p>
	While looking at it, I thought it would be cool to jump up and down on the mat to generate electricity as part of a video game. I started drawing in Flash, and switching from a school motif to a house, drew up a one-bedroom house with some energy draining objects. I made a rough prototype that was really just a drawing with an energy bar. When you pressed keys on the keyboard, the energy bar filled and then slowly drained and a window popped up letting me know what keys were pressed.</p>
<p>
	At this point, I connected the USB dance mat to the computer and used USB Overdrive as a middle-ware connector to turn jumps on the mat to keys on the keyboard. It was straightforward to make energy bars for several different things in the house and have them work independently. The final image shows the screen I worked in most of the time&mdash;using code to tweak the settings for each of the objects as well as the overall rate at which the energy builds up from jumping. I had begun to add other factors like outside temperature, air-conditioning, and a refrigerator but had to cut those in order to have it ready for the next Kidsteam design session.</p>
<p>
	I used Creative Commons licensed and public domain media for the television and music player. After it was over, the kids didn&rsquo;t like the video I had originally chosen. I found a long, public domain Bugs Bunny cartoon and used that as the video. The next time (and subsequent times) we played it, it was a huge success and generated a lot of great ideas and designs for the next version of this game.</p>

	When I began working on <em>Hypermarks: An Anthology of Electronic Literature</em> in 1999, I had grand plans. I was fresh out of graduate school and teaching courses in &ldquo;electronic literature and culture&rdquo; and &ldquo;hypertext fiction and poetry&rdquo; for the first time and in those still-heady days of bookmarks, hot lists, and home pages, I spent countless hours constructing links pages with finely tuned subcategories. In graduate school I had cut my teeth on the bulleted list &ndash; working throughout the mid 1990s on the <a href=""http://vos.ucsb.edu/""><em>Voice of the Shuttle</em></a>, the <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20110720074522/http:/english.ucsb.edu:591/rchrono/""><em>Romantic Chronology</em></a>, and <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20110720075258/http:/aad.english.ucsb.edu/""><em>The Affirmative Action and Diversity Project</em></a>, while at the same time developing my own research pages, first in the form of a catalogue of primary documents for my <a href=""http://www.english.ucsb.edu/faculty/rraley/research/englstud.html""><em>History of English Studies</em> <em>Page</em></a>. When working in the British Library in 1997, I started calling up the earliest anthologies of English poetry and meticulously transcribing their table of contents, which led to a collaboration with Laura Mandell on the <a href=""http://www.english.ucsb.edu/faculty/rraley/research/anthologies""><em>Anthologies and Miscellanies</em></a> page that we summarily described in these terms (full description below): &ldquo;we are not digital archivists per se &ndash; though we have tried to be as broadly inclusive as possible &ndash; and in the end what we have compiled is a list of texts, generally selected because they are somehow representative of critical tradition, of genre, of &lsquo;the spirit of an age,&rsquo; of epistemological ruptures.&rdquo; This then led to a collaboration with Mandell and Harriet Linkin on &ldquo;<a href=""http://www.orgs.muohio.edu/anthologies/"">The Anthologies Page</a>&rdquo; for <em>Romantic Circles</em> &ndash; another anthology and another list. Even in my dalliances I had veritable list mania, from the more high-minded transcription of Walter&rsquo;s Benjamin&rsquo;s theses on the writer&rsquo;s and critic&rsquo;s techniques to my whimsical list of cyberporn resources (&ldquo;compiled and selected with my own censorial eye, to be read only for the sake of information&rdquo;).</p>
<p>
	One of the first orders of business when I began teaching new courses, then, was the collation of links. There were some, but very few, such indices and none that I could find that articulated electronic literature both as a research-driven aesthetic practice and as an academic subject. Indeed, many of the extant indices eschewed taxonomy in favor of alphabetic order &ndash; a sure sign that a field is inchoate.</p>

	It was at this point that my plans became grand. My conviction was that the literary and artistic practices named as new media writing, net.writing, hypertext fiction, and digital poetry needed curatorial direction if they were going to become &ldquo;electronic literature,&rdquo; which is to say an academic field in its own right. Put another way, my sense was that the mode of collection and curation particular to an anthology was essential if these literary and artistic practices were to be granted the institutional recognition that they deserved. Individual academic studies &ndash; e.g. Espen Aarseth&rsquo;s <em>Cybertext</em> (1997) &ndash; were bringing the field into prominence but they alone were not going to be sufficient; what was required was a means by which works of electronic literature could be put to use in schools. In other words, we needed both knowledge of emergent literary genres and a means by which to facilitate their transmission.</p>
<p>
	Out of all this came my <em>Hypermarks</em> project, which I framed both as an anthology and as &ldquo;an index of online fiction, poetry, installations hypertext/ually in/formed.&rdquo; Begun in 1999 with support from the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota and the design assistance of two students, Aimee Houser and Martin Grider, it was, and still is, an anthology of electronic literature based on my master index but streamlined with four generic categories that more closely approximate the taxonomy of a print anthology: poetry; prose; installations &amp; exhibitions; journals &amp; indexes. Because of the use of inline frames, popups, and a form, it required Netscape 4.7 for full functionality, but its design aesthetic looked backwards to the monochromatic palette of Olia Lialina and the blue links of Mosaic. <em>Hypermarks</em> remains unfinished but is still publicly visible: number 2 on the Google search engine results page, for those mistyping &ldquo;hypermarkets.&rdquo; <em>Hypermarks</em> made the move with me from Minnesota to UC Santa Barbara, acquired a new URL, and continues to sit on our departmental server &ndash; no doubt to the chagrin of our IT administrator &ndash; but it is dormant. I never formally declared it to be shelved; and, more to the point, its shelving can only be identified retroactively, as a consequence of the cessation of work.</p>
<p>
	Absent a notice of when a page was last updated, a farewell post, or a public announcement of termination, it is sometimes difficult to determine the precise moment a project is shelved, the moment it crosses the threshold from &ldquo;in progress&rdquo; to dormancy, the moment incompleteness because its actual state. Absent as well the material acts of shelving &ndash; the deletion of either local or remote files, the surrendering of server space &ndash; incompleteness is a kind of abstraction. The potential to realize the project remains; it could, in theory, be shifted from one state of work to another, revived and moved further along toward completion. Because the possibility of its future realization is ever-present, a project without a notice of termination can really only be understood to be suspended in its &ldquo;middle state&rdquo; at the point that one realizes in retrospect that the work has stopped, that the project is no longer on a task list and has been supplanted by other ideas and other projects.</p>
<p>
	The &ldquo;middle state&rdquo; of <em>Hypermarks</em>, the limbo between conception and realization, was never articulated as such, but in-betweenness was an integral component of the project from the start. I maintained the usual theoretical skepticism about the notion of a complete collection, but <em>Voice of the Shuttle</em> had taught me to think carefully about the practical lifespan of archives, its utility as an academic resource becoming somewhat muted as search functionality increased. Moreover, <em>Hypermarks</em> was directly linked to my thinking about the mutable aspects of digital textuality. Building on Peter Lunenfeld&rsquo;s claim that electronic textuality is in a state of &ldquo;unfinish&rdquo; and Michael Joyce&rsquo;s claim that &ldquo;electronic text can never be completed,&rdquo; I was concerned in articles on the topic to show that digital textuality produced a kind of anamorphic vision, not, as for Espen Aarseth, because the anamorphic requires the reader to work to orient the text, but because it negotiates the threshold between perception and apperception. Anamorphic vision as I outlined it is not a matter of adjusting one&rsquo;s spectatorial position so as to correct perspective. Rather, it is the recognition of the impossibility of bringing simultaneously into view all of the material states of the text. The splash page for <em>Hypermarks</em> was designed to reflect all of this thinking, with the lines &ldquo;hypertext does not/ and indeed cannot/ attain a perfect realization&rdquo; fading to a blur. Such was my wry commentary on incompleteness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	But what would it have meant for it to be complete? And how would I have recognized it as such? It cannot simply be that it would have required an official launch to bring it into being, a notice that claimed ownership of the project&rsquo;s idea, because by these practical measures of publication, <em>Hypermarks</em> was live and even then locatable by search (many artists and authors found the site and contacted me with queries, thanks, and corrections). A citational act, one that recognizes and credits, articulates a project as an actually existing entity, irrespective of its state of completion and its future versioning. But I know <em>Hypermarks</em> to be frozen in its &ldquo;middle state,&rdquo; and, by contrast, <em>Anthologies and Miscellanies</em> to be complete, simply because I never folded it into another project. <em>Anthologies and Miscellanies</em> eventually morphed in part into the more comprehensive &ldquo;The Anthologies Page,&rdquo; but <em>Hypermarks</em> was never incorporated into another. The idea behind the project was to a certain extent fulfilled by the <a href=""http://collection.eliterature.org/2/"">Electronic Literature Collections</a>, but there was no text or file transfer out of which the latter emerged. The legacy code of <em>Hypermarks</em>, in other words, did not formally give rise to a different project, one that would have in its materialization relegated <em>Hypermarks</em> to the status of a version and thereby given it a terminus. It disappeared from my record of professional activities at some point between my reviews in 2002 and 2004, but it lives on as potential. In fact it was the recognition of its &ldquo;middle state&rdquo; prompted by this special issue that may very well at some point lead to its reanimation.</p>

	<span _fck_bookmark=""1"" style=""display: none;"">&nbsp;</span>This GIF image is one of a series of diagrams I used in&nbsp; meetings with ITVS to explain how the WORLD WITHOUT OIL online game would work. These &ldquo;middle-state&rdquo; meetings took place in August through October of 2006. At that time, I had submitted a proposal to do WORLD WITHOUT OIL for ITVS, and they liked the core idea very much, and had been assured by consultant Jane McGonigal that its game principles were sound. But nothing like WWO had ever been done before, so we met and I laid out the game workings for critique. The &ldquo;Game Engine&rdquo; diagram is a visual aid to understanding WWO&rsquo;s most vital dynamic: <em>how people get attracted to the game, how they play, and how their play both deepens their engagement and attracts more people.</em></p>
<p>
	(Background on WORLD WITHOUT OIL: it was a landmark game, the first alternate reality game (ARG) about a serious issue. WWO pretended an oil shock had begun and invited everyone to file &ldquo;eyewitness reports&rdquo; about it at the citizen crisis nerve center, <a href=""http://worldwithoutoil.org/"">worldwithoutoil.org</a>. People played by imagining what their lives would be like with less oil, expressed in emails, voicemails, videos and so on. Each day&rsquo;s player stories laid the foundation for the next day&rsquo;s play. In 32 days the game amassed over 1,500 stories, creating a remarkably diverse, perceptive and affecting &ldquo;pre-enactment&rdquo; of our next oil crisis. You can read more <a href=""http://worldwithoutoil.org/metaabout.htm"">here</a>.)</p>
<p>
	You begin &ldquo;Game Engine&rdquo; in the upper right corner, where people discover WWO online and enter the flow by the green dot. They see stories freshly created by other citizens, written as though the crisis is real. The site encourages visitors to respond in kind (the paths flowing counterclockwise from the green dot). It invites them to create their own stories that build on the ones they&rsquo;ve just seen, using whatever communication method they&rsquo;re comfortable with.</p>
<p>
	Their creations are added to the site (lower left corner) and the gamemasters curate it and learn from it (upper left corner). When, for example, players described how the oil shortage was devastating tourism, the gamemasters adopted and amplified that theme. This update enriches and freshens the oil crisis narrative which attracts more viewers and the game engine enters another cycle (upper right corner again). Thus every morning WWO players woke up to find new developments in the crisis and a new opportunity to help elucidate or solve the problem.</p>
<p align=""center"">
	* * * * *</p>
<p>
	As a game designer, I struggle to communicate my game ideas to others. My games in particular defy easy 2D visualization, because they operate with a heavy narrative dimension, and both games and narratives are best understood as flows, not flat images. With WWO, I was also striving to create a new kind of game that &ldquo;complexifies itself&rdquo; via crowdsourcing &ndash; another difficult dynamic to convey.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Game Engine&rdquo; is not a diagram I would create for myself. It shows relationships and processes that I feel I know intuitively, plus for simplicity&rsquo;s sake it assumes all players follow a similar path. In actuality I feel my highest challenge as game designer is to appreciate players as a cloud of skills, motivations, play rhythms etc. and to construct a game that accommodates as much of that cloud as it can.</p>
<p>
	The astute observer may look at &ldquo;Game Engine&rdquo; and wonder: <em>where&rsquo;s the game?</em> The diagram might seem to describe interactive not-games such as YouTube and LiveJournal. This resemblance is intentional: at that time, those communities were the leading edge of social media. Video and blogger communities do not &ldquo;go in a direction,&rdquo; however; they have no overarching narrative and no curation toward a goal. By introducing these elements, I made WWO something that you <em>played</em>.</p>
<p>
	As &ldquo;Game Engine&rdquo; indicates, WWO didn&rsquo;t <em>seem</em> like a game.&nbsp; This was quite intentional. First, I wanted to make sure WWO was inviting to non-gamers. Second, I wanted players to focus on the story, not game mechanics. Third, alternate reality games are famous for using &ldquo;TINAG&rdquo; (&ldquo;This Is Not A Game&rdquo;) as a device to heighten immersion in their stories &ndash; by believing its own fiction, the game helps players get inside the fiction too. I wanted WWO to excel in this regard.</p>
<p>
	The astute observer may also look at &ldquo;Game Engine&rdquo; and ask: <em>how come it says nothing about oil?</em> Truth is, WORLD WITHOUT OIL was not actually about oil or the lack thereof. As a public media non-profit, ITVS strives to broadcast stories from people who don&rsquo;t usually get the chance to be heard. True to this mission, WWO focused on&nbsp; getting people to share their stories, especially individuals and communities that media typically overlooks (see the box at the center of the diagram). Oil dependency plays an essential role as a narrative driver of that sharing, but as &ldquo;Game Engine&rdquo; reveals by absence, oil is not the game&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>
	If you&rsquo;ve read this far, you may want to know the end of the diagram&rsquo;s story &ndash; i.e., did the game engine work? Yes, remarkably well. One reviewer noted:</p>
<p>
	<strong>As a concerned citizen I am glad to see the &quot;game for good&quot; aspect of World Without Oil get a lot of airtime. As a student of game design, I see something far more fascinating going on: World Without Oil appears to be one of the most efficient content propagating narratives ever executed in an Alternate Reality Game context.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MARK HEGGEN &ndash; RE:TEXT</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;An efficient content propagating narrative&rdquo; is exactly what we set out to make.</p>
<p>
	Thank you, MediaCommons, for the impetus to relive some of WWO&rsquo;s formative moments and the opportunity to preserve a key moment of its middle-state history.&nbsp; &ndash;&nbsp;KE</p>

	This page is a fake version of a script template I&rsquo;m using at the moment for my project AUTHENTIC IN ALL CAPS. Since the project isn&rsquo;t released yet, I don&rsquo;t want to reveal storylines! So I&rsquo;ve replaced pertinent details for now, and will replace it with the actual script after launch. Although it may look like a normal film or television script, it isn&rsquo;t. This script, like the project, is the result of years of exploration and experimentation with documentation practices in transmedia. Transmedia (and other terms with the same meaning), describes projects that encompass a variety of distinct touch-points or media. In this project, it encompasses various fictional websites, mini-games, and mobile apps.</p>
<p>
	<strong>About the project</strong></p>
<p>
	AUTHENTIC IN ALL CAPS is a playful story experienced through an Internet app, using a unique combination of audio to drive traversal across fictional websites. Imagine putting headphones on at your computer, clicking on the app and opening up the introductory website. You hear a narrator, chatting about the site you see, and you&rsquo;re encouraged to take a journey across numerous fictional websites and hear a story unfold.</p>
<p>
	The use of audio to guide the player of this tale is an experiment in &ldquo;game approachability&rdquo;: the practice of &ldquo;making games initially more fun, friendly, and accessible to players who have the desire to play, yet do not always follow through to actually playing the game&rdquo; (Desurvire and Wiberg 131). Although AUTHENTIC is more a playful story than a game, the principle of approachability is just as pertinent in transmedia. The majority of people experience only a portion of dispersed works &ndash; whether they&rsquo;re dispersed across the web or across distinct media platforms.

	I have a rather ambivalent relationship with sound. For one, I enjoy listening to music and playing the drums. Both are hobbies for me. And when I&rsquo;m listening to a record or playing a set, my intent is to be as uncritical as possible&mdash;to assume and even embrace all of the stereotypes common to sonic culture: immersion in an affective experience, &ldquo;feeling it&rdquo; over &ldquo;thinking it,&rdquo; and improvising instead of outlining. I know all of these stereotypes are bunk. Music is at once an intellectual and affective endeavor, and for many academics it is an object of inquiry. Still, when I write about sound, I often want these stereotypes to hold true. Among other things, I struggle with translating the complexities of what I hear into writing. &ldquo;There is simply too much going on here to capture.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sucking all of the energy from it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Words don&rsquo;t do it justice.&rdquo; Sure, I&rsquo;ve felt the same way when writing about novels or poetry. But the thing is, I can at least quote, scan, or photocopy a print text. I can make parts of it co-present with my criticism. In the history of humanities scholarship, doing the same with audio is difficult at best. Not only are print monographs and journal articles still par for the course; they are also some of the very mechanisms through which scholarly practices are naturalized and measured. My fingers are crossed that such standards and mechanisms are changing.</p>
<p>
	In the meantime, I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with a platform architected specifically for multimodal scholarly communication. Called Scalar, it&rsquo;s a project of the Alliance for Networking Visual Culture (which is working to put the platform in the wild). Scholars including Alex Juhasz and Virginia Kuhn have already published with it, and I&rsquo;m using it to compose a cultural history of magnetic recording. At first, I was excited that Scalar would easily allow me to publish scholarship complete with audio on the web. Audiences could finally hear what I was writing about. However, as I continued to compose with Scalar, I quickly learned that it sparks a curious set of demands, namely concerns about how to write <em>with </em>sound instead of merely <em>about</em> it. Below is an example of what I mean, and it includes screen shots of my Scalar project. Since this cluster of the <em>The New Everyday </em>is titled <em>Rough Cuts</em>, I found it only fitting to select samples from my work on William S. Burroughs&rsquo;s cut-up experiments.</p>
<p>
	Here is how I normally write about audio and use it as a form of evidence:</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 1: Screenshot of a Paragraph in Scalar</p>
<p>
	This approach is ideal for print, and it lends itself nicely to sequential argumentation.</p>
<p>
	Initially, adding an audio clip (e.g., an excerpt of Burroughs&rsquo;s &ldquo;Origin and Theory of the Tape Cut-Ups&rdquo;) to this approach did not dramatically alter my writing. Rather, I put the file to the right of the text, ideally next to or near the sounds I was referencing. In the shot below, I am specifically quoting Burroughs saying: &ldquo;When you cut into the present, the future leaks out.&rdquo; With the multimodal interface, audiences can hear that sentence in the context of his April 1976 lecture at the Naropa Institute.</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 2: Screenshot of a Paragraph and Audio in Scalar</p>
<p>
	I then started to realize that, when the audio is co-present with my writing, I create some redundancies, which could be cut from my paragraphs. For instance, audiences do not necessarily need to read, &ldquo;Here, he is referring to when he cut an article by J. Paul Getty . . .&rdquo; After all, they can hear Burroughs saying this explicitly in the audio file.</p>
<p>
	I also began experimenting with where else the audio could be placed. Should it follow the linear logic of the paragraph? Should I insert it into the paragraph itself, rather than in the margins? With these questions in mind, here is one arrangement that emerged:</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 3: Screenshot of a Paragraph and Audio in Scalar</p>
<p>
	Using the &ldquo;history editor&rdquo; in Scalar, I can see the effects of my revisions. Version 10 (time-stamped 09:19, 07 October 2011) is 201 characters longer than Version 12 (time-stamped 09:33, 07 October 2011). At least at this juncture, it seems that writing with sound means less writing. Or at least less description.</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 4: Screenshot of the History Editor in Scalar</p>
<p>
	However, my earlier point about reducing redundancies in the text brought me to consider how annotations linked to the audio itself could be an effective way of providing some historical context for Burroughs&rsquo;s talk. For instance, during the talk he refers to &ldquo;one of Getty&rsquo;s sons.&rdquo; Yet he never names the son. As shown below, I can include an annotation explaining which of Getty&rsquo;s sons did in fact sue him, not to mention when, where, and for how much.</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 5: Screenshot of a Paragraph, Audio, and an Annotation in Scalar</p>
<p>
	One issue with this approach&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s necessarily a problem&mdash;is that the annotations tend to pop-up and cover my primary text. That is, the addition of an annotation layer in the interface too easily distracts audiences from the argument I am making. And so I began porting the argument itself more directly into the listening experience. Consider these three examples:</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 6: Screenshot of Audio and an Annotation in Scalar</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 7: Screenshot of Audio and an Annotation in Scalar</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 8: Screenshot of Audio and an Annotation in Scalar</p>
<p>
	As audiences listen to Burroughs&rsquo;s talk, they can now follow my argument about it. Here, not only does the temporality of my argument morph (e.g., audiences lose some agency over the pace and place of their reading). The space and form of interpretation morphs, too. Paragraphs shift to snippets, which pop-up and disappear depending on how I&rsquo;ve tagged and annotated the audio file.</p>
<p>
	And once my argument is synced with an audio file in this fashion, I can entirely rethink my initial, paragraph-based approach to writing about sound. The argument now looks like this:</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 9: Screenshot of Audio in Scalar</p>
<p>
	Visualized this way, audiences can quickly see the date and location of the talk, as well as the title track (&ldquo;Origin and Theory of the Tape Cut-Ups&rdquo;) and album (<em>Break Through in Grey Room</em>) from which the excerpt is drawn. This version, Version 14 (time-stamped 10:21, 07 October 2011), is 1923 characters shorter than Version 10 (pictured as Figure 1 above).</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 10: Screenshot of the History Editor in Scalar</p>
<p>
	I can also view the media file in Scalar and see my annotations listed in order of appearance. The image below only shows a few annotations, but it gives a sense of how the paragraph can be distributed and spatialized through the temporal logic of the audio file.</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 11: Screenshot of Audio and Annotations in Scalar</p>
<p>
	However, neither this image nor the difference in characters (i.e., 96 in Version 14 and 2019 in Version 10) means that electronic text becomes less important (even after redundancies are cut) in a multimodal, networked environment. Instead, the writing is granulated and exists in horizontal relationships with all other media in the project. Consequently, each annotation becomes a unique instance&mdash;a snippet of text with its own metadata, URL, and relations. Here is an example of one snippet in isolation:</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 12: Screenshot of an Annotation in Scalar</p>
<p>
	Such granularity becomes useful when visualizing the content of an entire project and the relationships within it. For instance, in the image below, all of the media files (i.e., audio, images, and video) in my project are visualized in Scalar.</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 13: Screenshot of a Media Visualization in Scalar</p>
<p>
	The green dots represent media files; the purple dots, annotations; and the orange dots, pages. I can see that, at least for now, four portions of my excerpt of &ldquo;Origin and Theory of the Tape Cut-Ups&rdquo; have been annotated, and two pages include or reference the excerpt. This visualization begs the question of what a page or an annotation implies, especially when everything in Scalar is essentially a unique instance that can relate to anything else. For now, I am inclined to say an annotation is a critical commentary on a specific slice of media (e.g., audio), and a page is a collection of (or a folder for) those annotations. Within Scalar, I can then visualize the relations of these snippets with the balance of the project:</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	Figure 14: Screenshot of a Radial Visualization in Scalar</p>
<p>
	This radial visualization is comparable to an index. With it, I can see that &ldquo;we had no explanation for this at the time&rdquo; is only mentioned once during the project, as an annotation of &ldquo;Origin and Theory of the Tape Cut-Ups,&rdquo; which is referenced in the page, &ldquo;Cutting into the Present.&rdquo; I can also see that &ldquo;Origin and Theory&rdquo; is tagged as an audio file; however, it is one among other audio files (seven, to be exact) in the project. As the project progresses and becomes more robust, this kind of emergent index will feed back into my writing, giving me an opportunity to express a network through processes impossible without a computer.</p>
<p>
	All of this work is indeed in progress, and I&rsquo;m still not sure whether syncing my arguments with audio files is the approach I prefer. I have also realized that, when granulating their projects, writers need to follow clear workflows and procedures in order to test an array of options. It is not all improvisation.</p>
<p>
	So, am I positive that a radial view of my project affords audiences any new information about the history of magnetic audio? Have I spelled out how, exactly, scholarly communications might benefit from networking electronic text, audio, and other media through many-to-many relations? Or have I explored ways that my multimodal project can be more accessible to multiple audiences, including those who may not be able to hear or navigate the sounds I&rsquo;m writing about? No, and not yet. But I hope to have responses soon.</p>
<p>
	For now, what I am learning from writing <em>with</em> sound is that, when composing with platforms like Scalar, scholars are practically provoked into speculation&mdash;into conjecturing with the multimodal forms of the data-driven web. A somewhat unfamiliar territory for the humanities, we might call this situation an ambivalent blend of thinking and feeling (including feelings of bewilderment, frustration, surprise, serendipity, confusion, and curiosity). Right now, that&rsquo;s certainly not a bad middle-state to be in.</p>

	This .jpg is a screenshot of my Adobe Illustrator &ldquo;inspiration workspace&rdquo;, a draft created in the process of redesigning the<em>Arcane Gallery of Gadgetry</em> (<em>AGOG</em>) site. <em>AGOG</em> is an educational narrative alternate reality game (ARG) with steampunk, Civil War, and time travel thematics (http://www.ArcaneGalleryOfGadgetry.org for more on the ARG); the redesign attempts to more obviously separate visitors seeking an entry into the ARG from those wishing to read about the research study behind the ARG&mdash;in ARG parlance, drawing a line between the TINAG (&ldquo;This Is Not A Game&rdquo;) and the TIAG.</p>
<p>
	For web design projects that draw strongly on some sort of literary narrative for inspiration (what I think of as &ldquo;narrative-based&rdquo; web design), I like to use Illustrator to pull all my digital inspiration resources into one workspace. I didn&rsquo;t intend this .ai file to turn into a wireframe or mock-up, and under ordinary circumstances I&rsquo;d never share it with anyone else; it&rsquo;s simply a step between the process of doodling notes in a sketchbook and creating a mock-up of the final site to share with design clients. An amalgamation of inspirational sources like this generally never sees an audience, whereas the next step mock-ups <em>are</em> produced with an audience in mind, even as they&rsquo;re at the same time technically drafts.</p>
<p>
	This file is as much a space defined by absence as by presence. Sketches and list of keywords framing the site&rsquo;s eventual look exist separately, on a large sketchpad propped on the wall behind my desk. My paper sketches deal more with the macro (e.g. layout blocking) or micro (e.g. logos), levels of design meriting their own .ai files; the inspiration workspace pulls together just those design elements that are difficult to plan using paper and pencil. It usually isn&rsquo;t worthwhile to type my pencilled notes into the workspace file, since I&rsquo;m now at the stage of playing around with those ideas in visual form; for example, &ldquo;looks like an actual shelf or desk with appropriate objects on it&rdquo; is translated here into the inclusion of reference images for objects and shelves. In addition to such beginning-state drafts, absent also is anything in the &ldquo;artboard&rdquo;, the bordered space at the workspace&rsquo;s center. For this kind of design work, I like to keep that area free for experimenting with pulling different images together, and later pull the site wireframe that exists in a separate .ai file into this space.</p>
<p>
	Whether it uses Adobe Illustrator or not, gathering web design inspiration is a curatorial process: think of choosing the items in an exhibit to create a desired visual effect. There&rsquo;s even a dark archive component! In this stage of the process, I pull in everything relevant, from creative-commons-licensed photographs to screenshots to closely copyrighted images; these latter have a place in the creation of the site&rsquo;s mood, though they&rsquo;re not used in the final public product.</p>
<p>
	Although I almost always visually chunk Illustrator space into themed areas (e.g. color palettes and font examples are separate from possible featured images), I usually don&rsquo;t go quite as far as dividing inspirational images into thematic areas, as I did with this workspace. Most projects don&rsquo;t require so many irreconcilable inspirational sources (e.g. I didn&rsquo;t plan to include all the maps, or all the photographs of historical figures). In the case of <em>AGOG</em>, it was clear I couldn&rsquo;t use everything I&rsquo;d flagged as a possible inspirational image, and separating my workspace into categories helped me make certain I included something from each area:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	1. <em>Background material </em>(bottom)<em>. </em>Textures, frames, and visual organizational ideas such as shelves.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	2. <em>Collage objects </em>(left). One design possibility was to create a page that replicates a physical space such as a desk or shelf. While the main images here would be illustrations of <em>AGOG</em>&rsquo;s key artifacts (such as the &ldquo;kairograph&rdquo; a spiritual telegraph), in the workspace I started to collect relevant items that might make the space look more real (e.g. compasses).</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	3. <em>Historical inspiration </em>(top). This area includes images of historical characters who have a place in the game&rsquo;s narrative (Clara Barton, Ellis Spear, Benjamin Franklin, and Walt Whitman) as well as resources relating to the game&rsquo;s steampunk/invention motif (e.g. the patent for a mechanical duck).</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">
	4. <em>Images from the first season of the ARG </em>(right). These serve as a reminder of the game&rsquo;s narrative and for also may be worked into the current design.</p>
<p>
	This workspace helped me keep the new design in line with the previous one; I pulled from inspirational images used in other <em>AGOG</em> sites, such as Victorian etchings, and I tried to hold inspirational images to a color palette that works well with antiqued paper (since <em>AGOG</em> uses aged historical documents such as patents and maps as major game components). I continued to add and remove images until the effect of the amassed visuals felt correct, regardless of which of the pieces would actually be used in the final work: the goal was to create a rough visual expression of the ideas behind the game, before translating that expression into a final site mock-up.</p>
<p>
	As I mentioned, this design draws on a literary narrative for inspiration: the mythology of <em>AGOG</em>. I&rsquo;m both a web designer and a literature scholar with interests in editorial theory, so I&rsquo;m keenly interested in how narratives are translated into web design, whether that means choices about the structure of an online scholarly edition or, as here, the look of a site based on a textual artifact. Too often, the web design of a digital scholarly production is treated as a post-critical activity, when in fact visual rhetoric makes a huge impact on how we interpret written data&mdash;and I suspect it&rsquo;s in middle-state artifacts like this workspace draft that we might begin to trace and prove a methodology of narrative-based web design.</p>
<p>
	Drawing an analog between textual editing and literary web design processes is tricky; where the underpinnings of the textual side of an editorial project are often part of a publicly released methodology, editors release the arguments and decisions feeding into the visual design of a scholarly edition far less often. Perhaps introducing a clearer drafting process for narrative-based web design, one that moves from inspirational sources to the final visual product and results in a written design methodology, might be a path toward witnessing connections between design elements their textual inspiration.</p>

	Bunker Hill: &quot;old town, lost town, shabby town, crook town&quot; (Raymond Chandler, <em>The High Window</em>) lay one steep block above the upscale downtown streets of Los Angeles. Graced with Queen Anne-style mansions first built for local aristocrats, by the 1950s it evolved into a low-income community housing pensioners, low-paid workers and Bohemians. Pressure from civic reformers and real-estate developers forced the Hill&#39;s destruction beginning in 1955. Today a flattened Bunker Hill is covered with highrise apartments and office buildings, museums and cultural venues, including the Walt Disney Concert Hall. None of the old structures remain.</p>
<p>
	Pre-redevelopment images of Bunker Hill reveal a neighborhood filled with grandiose houses wreathed in abundant southern California vegetation, often in spectacular stages of decay and romantic ruin. Its streetscapes are richly detailed with antiquated commercial signage and obsolete infrastructure. Arguably a posterchild for Los Angeles&#39;s constant self-reinvention, Bunker Hill&#39;s story exemplifies the indivisibility of renewal and destruction, embodying an idea that circulated in many cities with conspicuous reservoirs of poverty: that we must forcibly treat an acutely diseased organism by excising its offending parts. Reviled in its time, it now functions as a case study of how historical consciousness is fed by absence and loss. Overall its landscape is a real-life analogue for the fictional world of post-World War II film noir, and in fact the Hill was the venue for many noir location shoots.</p>

	This six-minute sequence containing three separate takes is a &quot;process plate,&quot; made to be projected on a background screen as part of a film shot taking place in a car, train or ship, or possibly behind a running person or galloping horse. You may remember seeing conversations taking place in a taxi, out of whose window we see an out-of-focus, fuzzy street going by. But the three plates on this roll are far from indistinct -- they&#39;re locked-down, rock-steady, razor-sharp long takes recording incidental American landscape scenes that might never have otherwise been captured. This particular clip comes from an unknown Columbia feature from the noir era, and is one of a number of plates shot around Los Angeles. I don&#39;t yet know for what movie this segment was shot, but the blogosphere has spoken and concluded that it was shot in 1947. One viewer even glimpsed her father, and when her sighting was called too good to be true, substantiated it with a birth certificate scan showing she was born at the address where the man in question stands.</p>
<p>
	Ever focused on economy, Hollywood studios saved much of the material they shot but didn&#39;t use in finished films. Studios and independent producers built large stock footage libraries containing generic footage (in which no name actors were seen) that they imagined might be suitable for use in future productions. Only a small percentage of this material was ever used, and most of it has never been seen. But what transpired to be useless for the studios has, without premeditation or plan, acquired retrospective value, because process plates function as deeply thick depictions of place and time. As stock footage, they possess potential to inflect new productions with accurate historical evidence, and are sometimes used this way. But I&#39;m more interested in the potential they offer when reused as found objects by themselves.</p>
<p>
	I&#39;ve remarked <a href=""http://blackoystercatcher.blogspot.com/2009/06/taking-history-back-from-storytellers.html"">elsewhere</a> on the endemic tendency to overnarrativize in current documentary.<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a> It strikes me that focusing on unpublished, intermediate documents not necessarily intended for use in their existing form gives makers opportunities to escape the suite of tired tropes that risk-averse distributors tend to prefer. Home movies offer one such opportunity; process plates another. Movement in space can be an alluring means of simulating travel in time. However enigmatic or aimless, process plates imply a journey that the spectator&#39;s mind jumps to decrypt and complete. And while they effectively inventory the landscape from a fixed point of view, the viewer&#39;s eye is constantly caught between center and periphery in an urgent attempt to catch and assimilate all the detail there is to be seen before it passes. What might seem to be little more than an empty shot out an automobile window instead becomes a desperate tease; we hope to see as much as we can of a vanished place/time before it disappears.</p>
<p>
	The process plates in this collection range widely through the 1930s-1950s American landscape. They contain riveting imagery of the Los Angeles urban core; the San Fernando Valley as an agricultural zone modulated by embryonic, cheap roadside businesses on the boulevards; industrial Chicago, Philadelphia and the Bronx seen from trains; the Midwestern farm belt; views of pre-freeway New York and San Francisco; and much more yet to be discovered. Their reuse potential would seem great, but they&#39;re seldom used. In part this is due to the steep license fees their custodians charge (soon to change, as Internet Archive begins to offer a collection for free use), but I&#39;d argue their lack of use is prompted principally by mediamakers&#39; reluctance to let images speak for themselves. Archival images are typically presented in bits and pieces, sweetened by immersive music and sound effects or contextualized by narration so as to remove ambiguity. While we pay constant tribute to archives as preservers of history, we rarely look at original, unmediated materials. It would be unfair, however, not to point to one striking exception: the wide reception of the 1906 film <em><a href=""http://www.archive.org/details/TripDownMarketStreetrBeforeTheFire"">A Trip Down Market Street Before the Fire</a></em>.<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a> Especially after its exposure on <em>60 Minutes</em>, this film seems to be serving as a kind of public induction into the richness of unedited archival material, and it&#39;s a rare example of a film that&#39;s leapt from the rarefied territory of silent-film scholarship into a populist classic.</p>
<p>
	In general, though, I&#39;d argue that the wide gap between potential and actual uses of the archival record speaks to its simultaneous urgency and irrelevancy. Archives often seem like a first-aid kit or a rusty tool, resources that we find reassuring but rarely use. More generally, the existence of archives is bolstered by a consensus that they&#39;re important (which I&#39;d argue is faith-based), but their value isn&#39;t confirmed by use. Not only unspoken but fragile, this consensus is unlikely to survive an era of externally imposed austerity unless archives find ways to defend the specificity and importance of their endeavors. As we slide into an era of historical simultaneity, as new and old images recombine and propagate through the culture, it becomes more difficult to understand how the specificity of the historical record helps us to contextualize the present and future. Archival enclosure is no option if archives are to survive. Perhaps pushing documents like this clip back into the public sphere can remind us that invisibility is not either.</p>

	Although electronic devices increasingly pervade our daily activities, the process from which these devices are conceived, refined, and finally produced is largely opaque, even if one peers behind the casing of the device and views the electronic components within. The intermediate stage artifact I am submitting is a photograph of a printed circuit board (PCB) (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). This particular PCB was used to prototype a novel electronic reading device created for my research about how such devices would fit into the reading activities of academics and knowledge workers. The completed reading device is a thin slate, similar in appearance to an Amazon Kindle DX, or Apple iPad, with an E-Ink electronic paper display (like that found on the black and white Kindles) (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). My goal with this artifact is to show that the process of creating electronics hardware probably has more in common with the other projects featured in the middle state collection than one might initially think. Multiple iterative cycles during which ideas are tested, and problems get fixed, and designs get refined all factor prominently into the creation of electronic hardware. Of course, the unique perspective I hope to contribute is how these iterations are achieved when it comes to electronics hardware.</p>

<p>
	As with any large project, an essential technique for maintaining one&rsquo;s sanity is to break the task into smaller, more manageable pieces. For electronics and software, it is much faster to diagnose and fix problems when the system is restricted in complexity. The PCB seen here is one such mini-prototype that allowed me to test a design for the graphics system of the reading device in isolation.</p>
<p>
	The main purpose of the circuit board was to make sure my design for conveying signals from a microprocessor to the electronic paper display was valid. As one of the most basic requirements for a reading device is the ability to show text and images on the electronic screen, this portion of the project was the critical point where a tangled mass of integrated circuits and other electronic components would first start to resemble a reading device.</p>
<p>
	Rather than get into the technical details about how the PCB works, it is far more interesting to talk about what happens when things do not work. Like most endeavors, the first run of a hardware prototype is far from perfect. Problems include wires that are connected to the wrong chip, bad math, incorrect assumptions about the electrical behavior of a circuit and, most frustrating, problematic interactions between components that only occur in a specific design. Thus begins the process of fixing the design to make it right.</p>
<p>
	The main challenge associated with revising a circuit design is that it ultimately means that the circuit board itself needs to change. For reasons of time and money (mostly time, as getting a new circuit board made and shipped out takes half a week at the quickest, not to mention the time needed to solder the different components onto the board), various techniques have developed to iterate one&#39;s design while minimizing the need to have new boards created. The photo of my PCB illustrates two of these techniques: &quot;green-wiring&quot; and banks of unpopulated components.</p>
<p>
	Green-wiring is the electronics equivalent of the editor&#39;s red pen. The term arises from the fact that historically these wires were green to help the wires blend in with the board, as back then, the costs of re-fabricating a PCB were prohibitive. When a part of the circuit does not work as planned, one can correct it by cutting away the wires printed on the board and then routing around the mistake using additional wires. Examples of green-wiring on the board include the thin blue wires to stabilize the power going to the display. A more visible use of this technique are the black and red wires that were used to add a comically-large power jack to the board after I discovered I had neglected to provide the screen with the correct voltage, and needed to obtain it from an external AC adapter. The art of green-wiring involves identifying the best locations to cut existing lines (generally where they are thinnest, and furthest way from other wires to minimize any collateral damage), and finding locations where it is feasible to attach the new wire (generally somewhere with a large enough piece of exposed metal to which the wire can be soldered &ndash; metallic contacts of board components are popular locations as seen in the photo).</p>
<p>
	The other technique visible on the board is the inclusion of alternative, backup circuit designs, which are left unpopulated with components. The careful eye will notice that there are spaces on the upper right corner of the board (by the labels R3, R4, U$10 and U$11) for electronics components that are not present. Since the cost of a circuit board does not change based on how many wires and spaces for components are printed on the board, using empty space on a board for alternative versions of a circuit allows designers to hedge their designs. If one is unsure about a design, many different candidates can be placed on one board. Should the first design not work, components can be placed into the alternative circuit to see if it performs better. For this board, I had two designs for the circuit that would power up the display and also reset it due to fact that the procedures provided in the display manufacturer&#39;s specifications were somewhat ambiguous about this topic.</p>
<p>
	Once the problems had been identified and the changes applied to this board, the digital schematic of the board was updated to incorporate the corrections much like how editing marks on paper might be transferred into a master word processor document. Additional functionality to test would was added, a new board was created and the process began anew.</p>
<p>
	I end with a complementary photo (<strong>Figure 3</strong>), which is a camera phone photo I took in 2008, when the necessary adjustments and corrections described above had been made. This photo shows the processor successfully showing an image on the display using the prototype board.</p>

	Place and stories have had an intimate kinship since narrative forms first emerged. As Nick Kaye writes in the introduction to his book <em>Site-Specific Art: Performance, Place and Documentation</em>, &ldquo;If one accepts the proposition that the meanings of utterances, actions and events are affected by their &lsquo;local position&rsquo;, by the <em>situation </em>of which they are a part, then a work of art, too, will be defined in relation to its place and position&rdquo; (1). This resonates true for oral narratives&rsquo; place-based nature (and association with the space of the community of listeners), the &ldquo;durable&rdquo; narratives carved into stone to chronicle the meaning of a site, and more ephemeral forms that utilize an alternative storytelling platforms like graffiti. In each example of an emerging storytelling platform, the indelible relationship between a story and its space is significant.</p>
<p>
	For me, the use of mobile media for storytelling seemed especially effective for capturing and experiencing this intimate relationship between narrative and place. These media are location aware, they can easily capture audio and text, and are currently the most pervasive computing form worldwide. Unlike prior media for storytelling, mobile and locative media can layer an almost innumerable number of stories onto a single site.</p>
<p>
	Yet, as I started to explore the options for storytelling with mobile devices in 2009 and 2010, there weren&rsquo;t any tools or applications that were able to accomplish what I had hoped to do with my students. I wanted my students to create site-specific fictional stories, walking tours, histories, or games. The available options included getting my students to find ways to creatively mis-use existing mobile media tools and apps like <a href=""http://www.geocaching.com/"">geocaching</a> (placing printed out stories in geocache containers), <a href=""http://yellowarrow.net"">Yellow Arrow</a> or QR code stickers that would unlock text messages or websites, or even using <a href=""http://foursquare.com/"">Foursquare</a> by adding narrative elements in the &ldquo;Tips&rdquo; section of a location. None of these options seemed ideal and, in collaboration with a Computer Science undergraduate, Chris Simmons, I decided to build my own storytelling app called StoryMarker.</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	<a href=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/storymarker_figure-1b.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/storymarker_figure-1b.preview.jpg"" /></a><br />
	<span class=""caption""><strong>Figure 1</strong>:&nbsp;Mockup of the home screen for the StoryMarker app, designed in January 2010 by Jason Farman. These mockups were transformed into the live app that ran on a few iPhones in early 2010.</span></p>
<p>
	The primary functionality for this app would be to record an audio story and attach it to a place by geotagging its coordinates (inspired by similar projects like Blast Theory&rsquo;s <a href=""http://www.blasttheory.co.uk/bt/work_rider_spoke.html""><em>Rider Spoke</em></a> and the Toronto-based <a href=""http://murmurtoronto.ca/""><em>[murmur]</em></a> project). As users of StoryMarker wandered past a location where a story was recorded, the app would alert them that a story was available in their vicinity. All stories would be audio-only in the first launch of the app and all stories would be available only if the listeners were standing in the spot where the story was recorded.</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	<a href=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/storymarker_figure-3.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/storymarker_figure-3.preview.jpg"" /></a><br />
	<span class=""caption""><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Mockup of the list view of the StoryMarker app, showing which stories were nearby to the user.</span></p>
<p>
	The motivation for these two limitations were debated quite a bit with the student I was working with and a faculty member in the Department of Art, <a href=""http://www.noprogram.org/"">Doug Gast</a>, who consulted with us on the project. From my perspective, the use of audio created an interesting relationship with the medium of the phone as a storytelling device: the app would utilize oral storytelling, which historically required proximity and synchronicity in order to be successful. Listeners to an oral narrative had to be in the same location at the same time. While we maintained the importance of mutual location, by dislocating the need for synchronous engagement, listeners build a deep sense of community and spatial relationships across asynchronous time.</p>
<p>
	This design choice complemented the continuing trend of using mobile phones for asynchronous connection between people through texting and email communication. This trend hit its nexus in 2009, as we began working through the planning stages for the project, when cellphones worldwide were used more for data transfer than for realtime voice communication (Wortham). Asynchronicity had become the dominant form of engagement and we wanted to explore some of the ways that this form of interaction can develop a deep sense of community and connection to a particular place.</p>
<p>
	In conjunction with this choice was the decision to &ldquo;lock&rdquo; all of the stories unless the participant was standing within proximity to the coordinates of the story. Part of this was an issue of motivation (i.e., how do we actually get people to walk to the place that this story is about?). By turning it into a game-like exploration of the stories of a place &mdash; like geocaching for narratives &mdash; we hoped that the need to hunt down the coordinates of a story would serve to motivate people to locate the place where the story was recorded. This was inspired by my own love of geocaching and the way that locative games can thoroughly transform the sense and purpose of a place.</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">

	<span class=""caption""><strong>Figure 3</strong>: Mockup of the map interface for the StoryMarker app. Pressing on a marker icon would open up a title and description of the story recorded in that location. Moving within proximity to the story would unlock the story for listeners.</span></p>
<p>
	While the motivating factors were very important in this decision to lock the stories unless a person was at the location, the larger reason for doing so was that, ultimately, we believed that the story would be incomplete without the environment as the setting of for the story. For me, the driving question was, &ldquo;What does site-specificity bring to the narrative experience?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The answers to that question continue to be far more complex than I had anticipated. Initially, I had conceived of the relationship between the stories and the spaces as one of context and narrative backdrop. The stories would play off of a site&rsquo;s context (e.g., in my students&rsquo; projects they used sites such as the university, a graveyard, and a nuclear reactor once associated with the Manhattan Project) and also utilize it as a backdrop, much in the same way a performance might utilize scene design to enact a sense of realism.</p>
<p>
	Yet, this answer simplifies the process of narrative, context, and site-specificity. My understanding of the relationship between these terms continues to fluctuate as my definition of them develops. While I have attempted to address the relationship between these categories in a more thorough way in my book, <a href=""http://www.mobileinterfacetheory.com""><em>Mobile Interface Theory</em></a>, I am aware that the interdependent nature of narrative, context, and site-specificity is rooted in a long genealogy that I am only beginning to trace.</p>
<p>
	As we considered these relational aspects of site-specific narrative for our app, it was also clear that these aspects were not only developed between the stories of the space and the media to tell those stories, but also the increasing significance we give the stories told by those in our networks. Thus, we realized that we needed to include a social component to the app. People would want to be able to filter the stories in a site based on those left by people in their network.</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, the StoryMarker app was never submitted to the Apple Store, in large part due to my relocation from Washington State to Maryland and Chris Simmons&rsquo; move to Japan. However, I still believe that the ideas driving the app are important in defining a significant, emerging way that our mobile devices are being used. Over the last couple of years since we designed StoryMarker, several apps have emerged with similar goals such as <a href=""http://broadcastr.com"">Broadcastr</a>, <a href=""http://7scenes.com/"">7scenes</a>, and <a href=""http://www.insydestory.com/"">InsydeStory</a>.</p>
<p>
	As I continue to think about this application and how it might develop and eventually launch, one thing that strikes me when I see my students&rsquo; explorations with similar apps is what I&rsquo;m currently terming the &ldquo;poverty of the screen&rdquo; for these narratives. The most compelling site-specific mobile narratives are those that get readers to interact with material objects in a meaningful way. The entirety of the story doesn&rsquo;t live strictly on the screen. Instead, the most dynamic mobile media narratives find a way to get readers to interact across the space of the screen with their immediate environment in a meaningful way. While this materiality can be enacted strictly through a digital device (a very material interface in numerous ways), this materiality needs to be compellingly highlighted in order to find a way for the narrative to move seamlessly across digital and physical spaces. This is one aspect that I continue to work through as I envision future forms that StoryMarker will take.</p>

	&ldquo;Middle-state&rdquo; forms in literary collections often reveal traces of people other than the primary author. A child&rsquo;s bright scribbles mixed with the pages of a manuscript draft suggest a writer whose creative process intersected with the lives of his children. An assistant&#39;s handwriting on the printout of a webpage hints at a collaborative research process. Often the person revealed is someone who has facilitated the author&rsquo;s writing life, and in doing so left her own deep imprint on the middle-state media and forms of a work.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Norman Mailer&rsquo;s working relationship with his long-time assistant Judith McNally provides a case in point. McNally assisted Mailer for nearly thirty years, and the <a href=""http://research.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/mailer.hp.html"">Norman Mailer Papers</a><strong>[link]</strong>at the Harry Ransom Center reflect their close collaboration. A proud Luddite, Mailer made it a &ldquo;point of honor&rdquo; not to use a computer.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a>Instead, he would handwrite or dictate a draft and give it to McNally for typing. McNally used a typewriter when she first started working for Mailer, and then transitioned to a computer in the mid- to late-1980s. When she finished a transcription, McNally would deliver the printout to Mailer, often via mail or fax. He would edit it and then return the marked-up copy to her. She would send him a clean copy that incorporated his changes, and then they would repeat the cycle.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	When McNally began working for Mailer in the late 1970s, her base of operations was an office on the ground floor of his apartment building in Brooklyn. After about ten years, she decided to work from her own home instead, just two blocks away. As Mailer got older and began spending more time in Provincetown, he and McNally relied more heavily on the fax machine and mail to exchange drafts. Throughout their working relationship they also talked on the phone an average of 25 to 50 times a week. &ldquo;We were communicators,&rdquo; Mailer explained in an interview I conducted with him in 2007. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had a relationship that was as intense, as narrow, as purposeful, as functional, and as removed as that.&rdquo; Mailer and McNally&rsquo;s way of working with each other remained essentially the same over the years, regardless of their physical proximity.<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a></p>

	The Ransom Center <a href=""http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/press/releases/2005/mailer.html"">purchased</a><strong>[link]</strong>Norman Mailer&rsquo;s papers for $2.5 million in 2005. Mailer donated a portion of that sum back to the Center to support the processing and upkeep of his materials. A team of two full-time archivists, two half-time archives assistants, and one work-study student spent two years cataloging his papers, which at over 1000 boxes constitute the largest single-author holding in the Center&rsquo;s collection.<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a><strong>[photo: redwine_stacks.jpg]</strong></p>

<p>
	The materials for the &ldquo;Bay of Pigs&rdquo; section of <em>Harlot&#39;s Ghost</em>, Mailer&rsquo;s 1991 novel chronicling the life of fictional CIA agent Harry Hubbard, illustrate the type of middle-state media and forms Mailer and McNally generated while producing a book. Research notes on index cards and a large, <a href=""https://webspace.utexas.edu/alicia36/MailerHarlotOutlineFullSize.jpg"">multi-colored organizational chart</a><strong>[link]</strong>, both in Mailer&rsquo;s distinctive scrawl, represent the book&rsquo;s early stages. Because of its size, the chart has been removed to flat file storage, where many of the Center&rsquo;s oversized paper items reside.</p>
<p>
	<strong>[2 photos side by side: redwine_cardbox.jpg and redwine_rehousedcards.jpg]</strong></p>
<p>
	The project archivists also transferred a tan metal index card box with &quot;Bay of Pigs&quot; written across the top in blood-red marker, to the Center&rsquo;s Personal Effects collection. The research note cards it contained were removed, labeled, and rehoused in an archival box alongside the bulk of Mailer&rsquo;s papers.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The Center&rsquo;s <em>Harlot&rsquo;s </em><em>Ghost</em> materials span 1985 to 1992. Bythe time Mailer dictated the &ldquo;Bay of Pigs&rdquo; section onto a series of five audio tapes in September 1989, he had transformed his initial research into a coherent plot summary. <strong>[photo: redwine_cassette.jpg] </strong>In one of the audio recordings, dated 16 September, Mailer clears his throat, we hear the rustle of a bag, he offers McNally some instructions, and then begins: &ldquo;We pick Harry up, still in Uruguay. He didn&rsquo;t get to Cuba quite so quickly as he thought, and in fact was held over until May...&rdquo; The cassettes themselves, which Mailer labeled in his own hand, have been assigned numbers and stored in document boxes in the Sound Recordings section of the stacks. The Center&rsquo;s Sound Recordings database<strong>[embed a link to this screenshot: redwine_soundrecdb.jpg]</strong>, which researchers can access in the reading room, provides descriptive metadata about the physical media, as well as a link to digitized versions of the original audio recordings.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The printout of McNally&rsquo;s earliest transcript for &quot;Bay of Pigs,&quot; dated 18 September, opens with the same words Mailer speaks on the audio tape: &ldquo;We pick Harry up, still in Uruguay&hellip;&rdquo; McNally wrote &ldquo;Harlot&rdquo; or &ldquo;HG&rdquo; on the labels of twenty-seven 5.25-inch floppy disks, yet none of them contains files for the opening pages of the &quot;Bay of Pigs&rdquo; section.<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""">[4]</a></p>
<p>
	<strong>[photo: redwine_disk.jpg]</strong></p>
<p>
	The Mailer Papers include over 400 disks and other digital media spanning approximately the mid-1980s to 2005. These items have been inventoried and recorded in the Center&rsquo;s internal Electronic Records database<strong>[embed a link to screenshot: redwine_erecdb.jpg]</strong> and now reside on shelves in my work space, near the machines I use to access the digital media in the Center&rsquo;s collection. Eventually, all digital media will be moved to a location in the stacks.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Although McNally&rsquo;s original disks and the digital files they contained are physically absent, the audio recordings and computer printouts suggest the disks&#39; original position in the progression of middle-state media. As the medium changed from cassette tape to digital to paper&mdash;with the &ldquo;digital to paper&rdquo; step reversing and repeating as McNally incorporated Mailer&rsquo;s handwritten corrections into her digital version and printed out fresh copy&mdash;Mailer continued to refine his language and the story. Echoes of the 16 September recording reverberate in the opening sentence of the published &ldquo;Bay of Pigs&rdquo; section: &quot;After Howard Hunt departed, I remained in Uruguay for several weeks and did not return to America until the beginning of May.&quot;<a href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title="""">[5]</a></p>

	<em>Harlot&rsquo;s Ghost</em> evolved from research notes, story charts, audio tapes, drafts, and digital files into a single, published book, but the archival materials related to the book are dispersed across different departments and floors throughout the Ransom Center. The archivists who processed Mailer&rsquo;s papers also created intermediary products in the course of their work. The content of some of these, such as the correspondence database we used to keep track of which letters were housed in which boxes<strong>[embed link to screenshot: redwine_corresdb.jpg]</strong>, was absorbed into the finished finding aid (see: <a href=""http://research.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/mailer.corr.html"">Index of Correspondents</a><strong>[link]</strong>), although the original format remains invisible to the general public. Other files and documents generated during processing initially served as internal references for staff&mdash;for example, a separation sheet marking the removal of an item to oversize storage&mdash;but also became permanent markers with information that helps guide researchers who come to use the materials. The finding aid itself went through several revisions before being finalized in three different forms: a Word document stored on one of the Center&rsquo;s servers, printouts filed in three different locations around the building, and an html version stored on a server and displayed online.<a href=""#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"" title="""">[6]</a></p>

<p>
	Literary archives and the finding aids that describe them represent layered networks of communication and collaboration. The middle-state media and forms within these holdings provide insight into a writer&#39;s creative process, reveal people like McNally whose work signficantly helped an author&#39;s literary production, and give a glimpse into the labor and interpretation that archivists undertake when organizing and describing a body of materials for use.</p>

	Envision a workshop atop a hill facing the ocean, a light breeze, ambient music, and a candle lit glow; now face your fears and release your innermost thoughts to a blank page that you will shortly read out loud to a group of strangers.&nbsp; It might seem scary at first, but this was how I began my studio notebook practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years ago in order to understand what my creative processes meant to me, I spent a week in Maine learning how to do proprioceptive writing and to use plain notebooks as a portable studio.&nbsp; There I learned to use a notebook to store my ideas before they became anything tangible.&nbsp; It was a strange and transformative experience that has followed me to this day.&nbsp; There were no rules on how to use your notebook, simply to work a little each day and devote time to your practice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	Below are some glimpses into my notebook studio, the work before the work: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	At first the pages seem arbitrary: fluffy fabric, torn pages, mud, and text filling the pages. But if you look deeper they all lead to some definitive idea that is unearthed from its pages.&nbsp; Is the art the notebook or is what comes from the book the art? The line is blurred and I see them as mirrors of one another.&nbsp; I often have ideas that sit with me for years and through my notebook I am able to revisit them and see where they may lead me.</p>

<p>
	Storytelling has been a lifelong interest for me. As a child I was fascinated with movies and literature.&nbsp; I would spend most weekends going to the movies to see anything from foreign films to Hollywood blockbusters.&nbsp; As an adult I studied film and photography, which eventually led me to interactive media.&nbsp; I was interested in finding ways to implant and embed stories into our everyday experiences; to blatantly reclaim the sense of wonder we often lose as adults.&nbsp; From this searching came the notion of embedding audio into threads.&nbsp; I wanted to find a way to embed or give the illusion of embedding audio into fabric and have it play stories of my childhood.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	Sonic Threads came out of those interests; the dress provides a way to share stories through touch and sound.&nbsp; When the embroidered threads on the dress are touched pre-recorded audio of children&rsquo;s fairy tale stories play through a set of speakers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	The images below show thoughts and designs that where not consciously linked but led me to the making of the storytelling dress. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>
	Sonic Threads began in my notebook and progressed to mini samples.&nbsp; Patterns are shown below:&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	The final design of the dress came from a pattern from the 1950s. The embroidery resembled sections of the stories they related to: a bear for Goldie Locks and the Three Bears, a wand for Cinderella, and a spinning circle for Rumpelstiltskin.&nbsp;</p>

14854,"contributed_pieces",5638,"""Taroko Gorge"" Printout",1,1338952345,1343969044,2,"<p>
	My offering is <a href=""http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/taroko_gorge_in_python.preview.jpg"" target=""_blank"">a printout</a> of the first version of &ldquo;Taroko Gorge,&rdquo; a simple poetry generator written in Python. This version of the generator was intended as a completed work, but it turned out not to be the last stage of this project within my own poetic practice or beyond it.</p>
<p>
	I had started a series of very small poetry generators, ppg256, just over a year before writing this one. While the poetry generators in that series (which is still <a href=""http://nickm.com/poems/ppg256.html"">ongoing</a>) are highly compressed 256-character programs, produce output that sounds avant-garde (or at least not very intelligible), and are written in Perl, &ldquo;Taroko Gorge&rdquo; was written under a different and more relaxed set of constraints. It was created to fit on a single page, with reasonably understandable variable names and explanatory comments. I defined this &ldquo;single page&rdquo; very traditionally, in terms of line printer output: The text was not to exceed 66 80-column lines. &ldquo;Taroko Gorge&rdquo; was meant to generate a boundless poem, as the ppg256 generators did, but this poem was to be a nature poem which would be more traditional and perhaps more identifiable, to some conventional readers, as poetic. And, it was written in Python, a language I prefer for sketching simple literary generators. Most would agree that Python is more easily legible and more easily modified and reworked than is Perl, which is sometimes called a &ldquo;write-only&rdquo; language because of its impenetrability. It&rsquo;s particularly difficult to modify Perl that is intentionally packed into as few characters as is possible. Python, on the other hand, proves fairly easy to consider even for first-time programmers. Indentation makes the scope of, for instance, while loops and if &hellip; else constructs clear even though curly braces are not needed to indicate blocks and even line-ending semicolons are not used in this program.</p>
<p>
	An additional constraint was that I would write the poetry generator in one day and would begin to write it, and draft most of it, at the place it is about, Taroko Gorge National Park in Taiwan. As I wrote and programmed, I did not attempt to parody nature poetry or Eastern poetic traditions. Rather, I sought to show that just as poets have written poems about the natural world as they looked upon it, one could also write a poetry generator about the natural world on the particular site.</p>
<p>
	The comments explain that there are three types of lines generated. The first and last line of any long stanza are &ldquo;path&rdquo; lines meant to suggest the experience of walking along an outdoor path and seeing natural features either above or below. One or more &ldquo;site&rdquo; lines may be generated between these. These lines are less active and are meant to suggest the experience of stopping at a viewing area. Finally, the indented one-line stanzas are &ldquo;cave&rdquo; lines meant to suggest the experience of moving through the tunnels that, like the paths, were carved through the rock by Chiang Kai-shek&#39;s Nationalist army. In many of these tunnels, which are not lit with artificial light, it is not possible to see the exit from the entrance on the other side. This is why the ending of the sentence in a &ldquo;cave&rdquo; line is also unseen. Although I used some one-letter function names, I tried to avoid obfuscation and explained each of the functions at least briefly in the comments at the top.</p>
<p>
	On March 3, I printed ten copies of the program on the dot matrix printer I have in my office. I sent the first copy to my hosts in Taiwan. Alongside the precious signature and date, I numbered each of these material texts in the format &ldquo;2/10 PRINTOUTS&rdquo; to emphasize that unlike these printouts, the program itself is not a multiple, does not exist in an edition, and (even though an explicit license is not attached here) is free for anyone to copy, run, and modify.</p>
<p>
	By March I also had written a JavaScript program that used exactly the same technique as the Python program to produce a boundless poem on the Web. While I do not find JavaScript suitable for clear thought and poetic experimentation, it is very useful for making a finished text-generating program easily available to the world. For this reason, I have written several poetry generators (&ldquo;The Two,&rdquo; &ldquo;Through the Park,&rdquo; and my collaboration with Stephanie Strickland, &ldquo;Sea and Spar Between&rdquo;) first in Python and have followed those versions with a more accessible JavaScript version. The JavaScript version is available here:</p>
<p>
	http://nickm.com/poems/taroko_gorge.html</p>
<p>
	After I put this JavaScript program online, I was rewarded with an amusing surprise. My friend and collaborator Scott Rettberg formulated his own remix of the program, &ldquo;Tokyo Garage,&rdquo; without asking permission &ndash; which, indeed, would have been unnecessary. He posted his program on March 17, explaining in a blog post that he &quot;hacked the words to make it more about urbanity, modernity, and my idea of Tokyo, a city I have never been to.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Over the next two and a half years, others have jumped on the bandwagon and into the gorge. J. R. Carpenter--who had already been using some of my Python programs as a starting point for text generation of her own, to produce texts that appeared in the book <em>Generation[s]--</em>reworked the generator to add images and new strands of text in three new pieces, &ldquo;Gorge,&rdquo; &ldquo;Whisper Wire,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Along the Briny Beach.&rdquo; Talan Memmott brought consumer excess and Comic Sans into the mix with &ldquo;Toy Garbage.&rdquo; Eric Snodgrass snipped up and reassembled Fluxus texts in &ldquo;Yoko Engorged.&rdquo; Mark Sample created a fannish tribute called &ldquo;Takei, Geoge.&rdquo; Flourish Klink followed that up with a generator of incestuous Harry Potter slash fiction, &ldquo;Fred and George.&rdquo; Maria Engberg gazed not at the natural world, but at the campus in her &ldquo;Alone Engaged.&rdquo; And to top all of these off, Andrew Plotkin produced &ldquo;Argot Ogre, OK!&rdquo; which scrolls code and text up the screen, remixing all of the different remixes individually and in pairs. Links to the remixes so far, along with screenshots, can be found here:</p>
<p>
	http://nickm.com/post/2011/09/yo-dawg-i-hear-you-like-taroko-gorge/</p>
<p>
	As I see it, these remixes say nothing about the poetic quality of my original program &ndash; but they speak endlessly about the diverse poetic potential of about a page of code. I would be delighted, of course, to see a hundred more remixes of &ldquo;Taroko Gorge.&rdquo; But even better if it becomes impossible to notice that they are related to my original program. Even better if ten other programs are written that work in completely different ways to generate poems, and each of these are themselves remixed ten times. The idea of developing computational art in a short amount of time, an hour or a day &ndash; an idea that I&rsquo;ve ripped off and remixed from many others &ndash; is what really deserves to get picked up and reworked, again and again.</p>

	I wanted to write a poem about sexual love between partners who discover that their middle-aged bodies are taking on the dilating form of their parents.&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens to eros when a lover looks at the beloved&rsquo;s body and finds the body of the beloved&rsquo;s mother or father in its place?&nbsp; What is the emotional experience, the psychic charge of that recognition?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The first formal impulse was to imitate the stanza of Spenser&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mutabilie Cantos,&rsquo; with its elaborate rhyme scheme and extended final line (pentameter stretching to hexameter). &nbsp;Why?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s difficult to say.&nbsp; Above the obvious interest in Spenser&rsquo;s theme, I simply wanted to try to make my own speech take that shape.&nbsp; I love the tune and formal turning of the verse in Spenser&rsquo;s poetry; it&rsquo;s a more recent attraction for me, having disliked his sophisticated elaborations when, as an undergraduate, I first encountered them in <em>The Fairie Queen</em>.&nbsp; Now I find them enchanting and powerful (such shifts of appreciation &amp; comprehension are one of the delights of getting older, maybe the only one!).&nbsp;&nbsp; I worked for a while on developing a feeling for how that stanza operates, as well as Spenser&rsquo;s ideas about material change, his diction, sentences, and rhetoric.&nbsp; At the same time, I was trying not to fall into Spenserian pastiche. &nbsp;Some of this labor is recorded in Drafts A-1 through A-4; Draft B-1 is the &lsquo;final&rsquo; draft of that compositional process in November 2009. &nbsp;(This is not how I mark my drafts habitually&mdash;I&rsquo;m haphazard at best, keeping in mind Hemingway&rsquo;s sentiment that &lsquo;posterity can take care of itself.&rsquo;)</p>
<p>
	You can see in the A-Drafts how I&rsquo;m sketching out the stanza scheme, which allows for some variation of end-rhyme, and playing with some of those correspondences ahead of the curve, as it were.&nbsp; Playing with rhymes outside of sentence making is like tumbling in a gravity-free chamber.&nbsp; The words connect, but their linking through sound is not determined by the connective tissue of an explicit syntax. &nbsp;One is exploring associations and possibilities that the ear of the rational mind can&rsquo;t hear.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s loads of fun.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the adventure of writing a poem; you set out not knowing where you&rsquo;re going, but having a good gait and an instinct of where to find the trailhead, and when to veer off.</p>
<p>
	Once I got into it, I was excited to find myself writing these stanzas with some facility; it was like discovering you could slalom fast down the mountain after a week in snowshoes.</p>
<p>
	But early in 2010, the poem came to sound like an unmitigated fucking disaster.&nbsp; What had happened?</p>
<p>
	I had fallen into the pastiche I was trying to avoid, for one thing.&nbsp; Also, the metrical contract was leading me into some awkward phrasing; I wasn&rsquo;t in full control of meter, metaphor, and rhetoric, and how they need to fuse into a single element coursing through the poem.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had distracted myself with these &ldquo;crafty&rdquo; problems, and willfully lost my bearing in the more difficult emotional terrain.&nbsp; I had hooded myself in Spenser&rsquo;s idealism, and wasn&rsquo;t able, in the end, to separate the threads of idealism from the</p>
<p>
	word-fabric of his stanza.&nbsp; I had the terrible sinking feeling that I didn&rsquo;t know what the hell I was doing.&nbsp; I was avoiding precisely the problem I had set out to explore.&nbsp; Ignorance is a source of poetry, Wallace Stevens reminds us.&nbsp; These early drafts are not what he was talking about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	I put the poem away for about 18 months.&nbsp; The most difficult thing in writing a poem is to know when you&rsquo;re putting yourself on.&nbsp; I had fooled myself into thinking I was doing the real work, but the fun I had had with craft (poem-making) distracted me from what Seamus Heaney calls <em>technique</em>, which is not synonymous with craft, but rather the poet&rsquo;s stance towards language, experience, and the larger world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Each time I picked up the poem it sounded ridiculous and looked hopeless.&nbsp; Finally, I was able to hold the thing up with some objectivity, neither appraising nor dismissing, and I could hear something I wanted to save, even redeem (the way you redeem an empty bottle for a nickel).&nbsp; I isolated a few sets of lines that still seemed alive and truthful.&nbsp; You can find that highlighting in Draft B-2.&nbsp; I also still liked the poem&rsquo;s gambit.</p>
<p>
	I decided to pull the poem out of the Spenserian stanza; to use a short flexible line with which I had had some satisfaction more recently in other poems; and to explore again the emotional conflict at the center of the poem, to voice some of the darker harmonies. Maybe abandoning the measure of the stanza would help me wise-up to false feelings in the poem. &nbsp;You can see how I was working towards that in Drafts C-1 through C-3.&nbsp; Whereas the A-Drafts show me building the poem stanza by stanza in a more or less linear fashion, the C-Drafts indicate how I broke open the poem at different points to layer in additional images, figures, vocal tones, emotional shades, and turns of argument.</p>
<p>
	For example, one of the keys to unlocking the failed drafts came from a suggestion by another poet, a friend, who pointed me towards Erich Neumann&rsquo;s monumental study of the archetype of &lsquo;the great mother.&rsquo;&nbsp; When I found an image&mdash;I mean, a reproduction of a sculpture&mdash;of the Egyptian goddess Ta-Urt (parts hippo, lion, woman, crocodile, daughter of Ra, who guards the gateway to the afterlife), the terror &amp; dread that I had avoided in the early drafts seemed to have found a symbol, or at least an adequate object.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s difficult to convey, but the image scared &amp; held me at first glance, before I understood what it meant.&nbsp; It took a while to figure out how to plot the appearance of that image, and the poem went through several new drafts before I found the place to break open some lines and lay in the new stuff.&nbsp; I often find myself working in this manner&mdash;refining, enriching, and complicating the poem, so that its form takes on, I hope, increasingly greater and more dynamic definition.&nbsp; This process involves, too, a lot of cutting away.</p>
<p>
	I don&rsquo;t think any of this is unusual.&nbsp; Whether or not the poem&rsquo;s a keeper, it&rsquo;s too soon to say.&nbsp; One thing a good poet and a bad poet may have in common is an interesting process. &nbsp;But the process of writing the poem and the experience of reading it are never the same, even when the experience of reading is directed towards the process of writing itself.&nbsp; &nbsp;And the poet can never mistake the one for the other.&nbsp; The space between the two can shrink, but it never collapses.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s about the extent of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	&ldquo;<em>Jurassic Park</em>&nbsp;heralded a revolution in movies as profound as the coming of sound in 1927.&rdquo;[1] This quotation is but one of a consensus of pronouncements that have canonized <em>Jurassic Park</em> as a milestone in Hollywood&rsquo;s use of CGI, signaling a new era in film history. The emphasis on the film&rsquo;s revolutionary qualities has obscured the extent to which the film&rsquo;s visualizations of dinosaurs relied on more traditional methods of animation, however. What emerges from a more careful consideration of <em>Jurassic Park</em>&rsquo;s special effects is an appreciation of the intricate mixture of traditional effects&mdash;stop-motion miniatures, large-scale animatronics&mdash;together with advancement in CGI. The general success of the film&rsquo;s effects work can be attributed to its relatively sparing use of CGI and the care with which these effects were combined with time-tested methods.</p>
<p>
	So, for example, one of the film&rsquo;s preproduction stories involves Spielberg&rsquo;s decision to use CGI instead of Phil Tippett&rsquo;s &ldquo;Go motion,&rdquo; a computer-aided refinement of stop-motion techniques. After watching an early CGI scene of the T. Rex chasing a herd of Gallimimus, Stephen Spielberg turned to Tippett and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re out of a job,&rdquo; to which Tippett replied, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mean extinct?&rdquo; This witty bit of banter, a version of which Spielberg inserted into the film&rsquo;s dialogue, exaggerates the impact of the CGI animation, however. Far from being out of a job, the stop-motion team continued to advise the CGI team, since the stop-motion animators&rsquo; craft knowledge of how to animate proved an invaluable aid to the CGI team&rsquo;s development of realistic movement. This teamwork involved the creation of a new technology, the &ldquo;Dinosaur Input Device,&rdquo; an interface that allowed the stop-motion animators to input data for the CGI software using traditional stop-motion manual manipulation, a device that materialized the symbiosis between traditional and emergent special effects techniques (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). The stop-motion/CGI interaction is thus one example of a process of exchange between established and emergent special-effects practices.</p>
<p class=""rtecenter"">
	<img src=""/tne/sites/mediacommons.futureofthebook.org.tne/files/images/oliver_dinosaur_input_device.preview.jpg"" /><br />
	<br />
	<strong>Figure 1:&nbsp;Dinosaur Input Device. A mechanical dinosaur is manipulated by an animator. The stop-motion data is then fed to a software program to create a realistic 3D computer model of the dinosaur.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
	A similar dynamic takes place in the interplay between <em>Jurassic Park</em>&rsquo;s effects and scientific visualization practices. As work by Michelle Pierson, Eric Faden, and others has indicated, digital special effects have manifold and profound links to scientific visualization. When regarded from this perspective <em>Jurassic Park</em> contributes to an understanding of science fiction that emphasizes how the genre continually involves the production of something other than sheer fantasy. The film&rsquo;s raptors were initially based on a falsification, a kind of wishful thinking based on narrative demands, but then a paleontological discovery made the film&rsquo;s vision of the raptors seem more plausible. As Stan Winston joked, &ldquo;We made it, then they discovered it.&rdquo;[2] This fortuitousness, where reality catches up with and/or proves fiction, was not the only way that the film interfaced with knowledge production, however. The effects teams relied on paleontological knowledge of dinosaur anatomy, which was provided largely by science advisors, but the intuitive knowledge of the stop-motion team led to new paleontological knowledge as well. These insights came about as a result of a form of knowledge derived from the animators&rsquo; craft understanding of how dinosaurs &ldquo;should&rdquo; move. This material extrapolation was based in part on exercises where the animators enacted some of the dinosaur movements, using a form of introjective mimicry to guide their work. These craft practices led to a recalibration of paleontological thinking about dinosaur physiology.</p>
<p>
	Overall, then, special effects in <em>Jurassic Park</em> rely on overlapping stop-motion and CGI techniques, as well as deep synergies with scientific visualization processes.</p>

	<em>Rough Cuts: Media and Design in Process</em>is a collection of two dozen &ldquo;middle-state&rdquo; artifacts produced by artists and designers, each of which pulls back the curtain on the creative process. The concept behind the collection is to make visible what Dan Cohen calls the &quot;hidden archive&quot; of notes, sketches, fragments, low-fidelity prototypes, and drafts that are part of the development of a &ldquo;final&rdquo; (or sometimes perpetually unfinished or abandoned) scholarly or creative work.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""">[1]</a> The term &ldquo;middle-state&rdquo; is borrowed and adapted from TNE&rsquo;s experiment in producing &ldquo;a web publication that exists &lsquo;between a blog and a journal,&rsquo; also known as &lsquo;middle state&rsquo; publishing.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""">[2]</a></p>
<p>
	Contributors to <em>Rough Cuts</em> include a novelist, poet, playwright, electronic textile artist, comic book artist, digital archivist, and game designer, among others. The proliferation of terms they use&mdash;some familiar and colloquial, others specialized or newly coined&mdash;to label and describe their artifacts speaks to the diversity of the collection: <em>process plate</em>, <em>doodle</em>, <em>script template</em>, <em>after-action report</em>, <em>printed circuit board, tactile notebook, </em>and<em>pre-press original comic book page, </em>to name just a few. By drawing HCI into the orbit of the studio arts, the collection allows us to discern points of similarity and difference across different schools of design. Nicholas Chen, for example, likens the process of &ldquo;green-wiring&rdquo;--rewiring traces on the printed circuit board for his electronic reading device--to the act of copy-editing and revising a literary manuscript (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). And transmedia writer and designer Christy Dena&rsquo;s interest in documentation &ldquo;approachability&rdquo; resonates with long-standing principles of user-centered design in HCI. Conversely, Mark Sample&rsquo;s &ldquo;artisanal tweets&rdquo;&mdash;140 character messages inscribed on postcards and delivered via surface mail&mdash;subvert reader expectations about the instantaneity of communication in an age of social media. Sample&rsquo;s project is a reminder that in the arts &amp; humanities, user <em>provocation</em> rather than user satisfaction is often the goal.</p>

<p>
	One way to think about <em>Rough Cuts</em> is as a repository of metaphors about the creative process.&nbsp; For Beth Bonsignore, designing an historical Alternate Reality Game (ARG) is akin to weaving the weft of fiction into the warp of history.&nbsp; For Oliver Gaycken, it&rsquo;s the act of <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=3468"">remediation</a>that&rsquo;s of interest: Gaycken explains how the groundbreaking use of CGI in Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s <em>Jurassic Park</em> relied both conceptually and technologically on the prior art of stop-motion animation. At other times, the dominance of one technology can obscure the affordances of another: Jentery Sayers, for example, discusses his initial struggles to divest himself of print metaphors when &ldquo;writing with sound.&rdquo; This, indeed, is the sticky wicket of metaphor: it can usher in bright new ways of thinking, or it can prolong the rut of the old (along these lines, it has been claimed that Sony Corporation temporarily nixed its plans to develop CD technology in the 1970s because the standard 12&rdquo; diameter of LPs was holding hostage alternative, more commercially viable mental models of smaller laser disks).<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""">[3]</a></p>
<p>
	There&rsquo;s another set of metaphors I want to draw attention to, which revolve around the twin concepts of progress and evolution: we often speak about the &ldquo;origin&rdquo; of an idea or the &ldquo;growth&rdquo; or &ldquo;development&rdquo; of a poem or performance. The tenacity of these developmental metaphors&mdash;the near impossibility of avoiding them--is evidenced by the fact that they appear under various guises throughout this introduction, despite my best efforts to root them out. Although such language might at first seem to capture something fundamental about the creative act, it nonetheless favors a success narrative that belies what can be an intensely discouraging experience.&nbsp; Discussing the role of frustration in creativity, science writer Jonah Lehrer notes in his new book <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Imagine-Creativity-Works-Jonah-Lehrer/dp/0547386079/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1343186878&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=jonah+lehrer"">Imagine</a>&nbsp;</em>how this key ingredient often goes unacknowledged:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">
	When we tell one another stories about creativity, we tend to leave out this phase of the creative process. We neglect to mention those days when we wanted to quit, when we believed that our problems were impossible to solve. Because such failures contradict the romantic version of events&mdash;there is nothing triumphant about a false start&mdash;we forget all about them . . . Instead, we skip straight to the breakthroughs. We tell the happy endings first.<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""">[4]</a></p>
<p>
	In a contribution to <em>Rough Cuts</em> that brilliantly bucks the happy-ending trope, poet Joshua Weiner puts the focus squarely on failure, at one point calling a draft-in-progress an &ldquo;unmitigated fucking disaster.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here success doesn&rsquo;t feel pre-ordained; the life or death of a poem hangs in the balance. What emerges in the course of Weiner&rsquo;s commentary is the ability to let brutal self-knowledge guide a process that involves salvaging a few promising fragments and slowly building them back up. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The artifacts in the collection raise interesting questions about audience: for whom were they originally created, and for what purpose? Many, of course, were intended strictly for personal use. But even among these, there is sometimes a degree of beauty and craftsmanship that seems to presuppose a more public life; an attention to detail that pushes them more toward the cooked than the raw end of the design spectrum, notwithstanding their improvisational qualities. Rita Shewbridge&rsquo;s tactile notebooks, for example, contain the seeds of an idea that eventually resulted in an interactive storytelling dress. The variegated textures of the notebooks and their riot of colors and material, including mud and thread, give them an almost protean quality, as though they&rsquo;re beginning to shape-shift into the textiles they inspire. As Shewbridge asks, &ldquo;Is the art the notebook or is what comes from the book the art?&rdquo; In other cases, middle-state artifacts were expressly created for someone other than the author. Ken Eklund&rsquo;s game engine diagram for <em><a href=""http://www.worldwithoutoil.org/"">World Without Oil</a></em>--the ARG that launched the forecasting game genre in 2007--was made for executives at ITVS, the non-profit organization sponsoring the project. Eklund writes that &ldquo;Game Engine&rdquo; is not a diagram he would have ever created for himself since it expresses information that he had already fully internalized; rather it functioned as a boundary object between Eklund and his funders that aided them in communicating about how the game would work.</p>
<p>
	And what of the ongoing value of the artifacts, once they&rsquo;ve fulfilled their initial purpose? The very existence of a collection like <em>Rough Cuts</em> suggests they may have potential readers, listeners, or viewers beyond those envisioned by their creators. This, indeed, is the <em>raison d&rsquo;etre</em> for historical archives, which are premised on the idea that some records have enduring significance that warrants keeping and preserving them long after their creators are done with them. But as Rick Prelinger&mdash;moving image archivist at the Internet Archive--soberly observes, this assumption is often &ldquo;faith-based&rdquo; rather than evidence-based. &ldquo;Archives often seem like a first-aid kit or a rusty tool,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;resources that we find reassuring but rarely use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	If Prelinger is right, then we ought to ask the same question of <em>Rough Cuts</em> that we would of archives, which is what types of use does the collection conceivably support?&nbsp; Part of the answer lies with teasing out why we are drawn to middle-state artifacts in the first place. A kind of temporal extrusion, they expose process and remind us that our artifactual and built environments are in a continuous state of becoming.&nbsp; At a physiological level, our fascination is consistent with the workings of the human perceptual system, which constantly extracts temporal information from the world around it&mdash;including, paradoxically, from seemingly static objects.<a href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title="""">[5]</a> Laboratory experiments show, for example, that when we view partially illegible handwritten characters, we rely on knowledge about how those characters were most likely drawn to help us decipher them.<a href=""#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"" title="""">[6]</a> And when exposed to similar-looking objects that vary systematically along a continuum&mdash;such as a series of rectangles that become progressively thicker or thinner&mdash;our memory of the final object will be distorted further along the implied axis of change, a phenomenon scientist Jennifer Freyd has aptly dubbed &ldquo;representational momentum.&rdquo;<a href=""#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"" title="""">[7]</a> Our cognitive encounters with objects are thus deeply scored by time: we have an extraordinary capacity for mentally reconstructing their past states and projecting their future ones, and we are primed by thousands of years of evolution to seek out evidence of process and transformation. The ability for middle-state artifacts to exert a gravitational pull on our consciousness should therefore come as little surprise.</p>

	<strong>Figure 2: A progression of rectangles, from thin to thick, after Jennifer Freyd, et al. Lab experiments by Freyd and colleagues predict that individuals will mistakenly recall the last rectangle in the series as thicker than it really is, a form of memory distortion known as &ldquo;representational momentum.&rdquo; The same phenomenon has been reported for other types of transformations in a series, including auditory stimuli involving changes in the pitches of a tone (&ldquo;auditory momentum&rdquo;). &nbsp;</strong></p>

	One of Prelinger&rsquo;s <a href=""http://blackoystercatcher.blogspot.com/2009/06/taking-history-back-from-storytellers.html"">proposals</a>&nbsp;for making archives more relevant and vital is for archivists to model active re-use of the materials in their collections&mdash;by incorporating vintage footage into their own film documentaries, for instance.<a href=""#_ftn8"" name=""_ftnref8"" title="""">[8]</a> Similarly, Nick Montfort puts remixing front and center in his contribution to <em>Rough Cuts</em>, albeit by emphasizing the reader&rsquo;s agency rather than the archivist&rsquo;s: his <a href=""http://nickm.com/poems/taroko_gorge.html"">Taroko Gorge poetry generator</a>&nbsp;has spawned at least <a href=""http://nickm.com/post/2011/09/yo-dawg-i-hear-you-like-taroko-gorge/"">eleven reimaginings</a>&nbsp;since he made a javascript version publicly available. Creating mashups and critical responses, however, by no means exhausts the range of possibilities. As design resources, <em>Rough Cuts</em> and other middle-state collections have the potential to inspire new tools and methods for supporting creativity. What might it be like, for instance, to work within a design environment whose interface was governed by something other than developmental metaphors, to hearken back to the earlier discussion? Or an environment that treated mistakes not as flaws to be papered over, but as design primitives whose imperfections enrich creativity? What if HCI labs routinely incorporated user provocation as well as user satisfaction into their methodologies? No less an authority than Donald Norman has advocated for the importance of both: his <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Design-Love-Everyday-Things/dp/0465051367/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1343498154&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=donald+norman+emotional+design"">classic book</a> on emotional design begins with the story of three teapots that sit atop his kitchen shelf:<a href=""#_ftn9"" name=""_ftnref9"" title="""">[9]</a></p>
<p align=""left"">
	<strong>Figure 3: Norman&rsquo;s teapots, each emphasizing a different design paradigm. From left to right: reflective, visceral, and behavioral design.</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">
	Norman&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;masochistic&rdquo; teapot on the left is rendered perversely unusable by the position of the spout below the handle; the Nanna teapot in the middle combines charm and functionality; and the tilting teapot on the right&mdash;which involves temporarily leaning the pot backward to steep the tea leaves--is an exercise in studied usability.&nbsp; Adopting the terminology of <em>reflective</em>, <em>visceral</em>, and <em>behavioral</em> to refer to the predominant design orientation of each, Norman argues that &ldquo;it is not possible to have a story about design without all three.&rdquo;&nbsp; However disparate the teapots seem, taken together they speak to a coherent design philosophy; they combine an applied perspective (the behavioral dimension) with a more playful or provocative one (the reflective dimension).<a href=""#_ftn10"" name=""_ftnref10"" title="""">[10]</a> The visceral dimension exemplified by the Nanna teapot brings beauty into the equation as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The role of reflective design in this trio is key: it is what helps us discover fault lines in the objects, artifacts, or systems being explored&mdash;the location of a teapot&rsquo;s spout or the mode of a tweet&rsquo;s transmission&mdash;and in doing so allows us <em>to imagine them otherwise</em>: to see them as alterable rather than immutable; as possibility spaces rather than rigid, inherited structures.<a href=""#_ftn11"" name=""_ftnref11"" title="""">[11]</a> It is this dimension of design that allows us to envision ourselves as creative agents of change.</p>
<p>
	The current incarnation of <em>Rough Cuts</em> is itself intended to be intermediate: it is my hope to expand the collection over time. If you have a middle-state artifact you&rsquo;d like to submit, email me at <a href=""mailto:karimkraus@gmail.com"">karimkraus@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m particularly interested in artifacts relating to dance, which is unrepresented in the collection. I&rsquo;d also like to feature one or more artifacts related to design fiction or media archaeological practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	My thanks to Nick Mirzoeff and Brian Hoffman at New York University for their help and guidance in seeing this collection through to publication. Special thanks to my terrific co-curator Amalia Levi for her careful eye; and lastly my gratitude to all our brilliant contributors.</p>
