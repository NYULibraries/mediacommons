	This cluster emphasizes that violence and intolerance are not exceptional but central parts of everyday life. This violence forms a nexus of religion, law and politics that expresses the complexity of the quotidian.

	The grocery list: scribbled on the back of last month&rsquo;s electricity bill, or stored on the Droid, where it&rsquo;s conveniently organized by supermarket aisle number. That minor epiphany that struck on the subway: transcribed to a Moleskin, or translated into a Voice Memo on the&nbsp;iPhone.</p>

	This cluster examines how different processes of and platforms for note-taking shape the everyday ways we think, record, and remember.</p>

	<a href=\"http://pzacad.pitzer.edu/~ajuhasz/\"><strong>Alex Juhasz</strong></a> and I initiate a conversation about social media that sidesteps the panic over youth and digital distraction, and instead looks head-on at their everyday engagements with mobile devices and social networking. Our aim is to challenge pathologizing discourses that frame young users of social media as simultaneously victims and threat.</p>

	On June 14 and 15, 2011, six upper division undergraduate students from the University of South Carolina went out into the streets of Columbia [SC]. Their assignment: to observe how surveillance happens in and around them everyday. Their findings are presented here. Informed by readings in theory, visual-material culture, and constitutional law, as well as fiction, films, and online news articles, the students offer a timely commentary on the routine--and often unacknowledged--practices of surveillance.</p>

	In the aftermath of the co-ordinated attack on Occupy sites across the US on 11/15, Occupy the Everyday replies by asserting that Occupy lives, Occupy is live, we occupy the live. This is the first, emergency cluster in a new formation of this project: Occupy the Everyday. Four New Yorkers--occupiers, working group activists, supporters--work out their first reactions here.</p>
<p>
	The cluster remains open for new contributions, please write and submit!</p>
<p>
	Here&#39;s the call: Eighty-odd weeks ago, TNE launched, suggesting that there was a new everyday in the making but that it was not yet clear what it was going to be. Occupy has filled that blank. This is an project about Occupy, for as long as the community wants to debate it. The everyday Occupy: how is Occupying being practiced in your community/country/university? Who is occupying? Who isn&rsquo;t? Occupy space: what is the space being occupied? Public, private, public-private, something else? Occupy theory: occupy theory is what we do as we occupy, its process and procedure. It is building, hacking, theorizing: is it a coincidence that the digital humanities has (re)discovered theory in the period of Occupy? Occupy technology: OWS relies mostly on some very simple tools: Google docs, gmail, Google groups, Twitter. What other initiatives are there in occupying technology? Occupy education: student debt, the college athlete as the one percent, horizontal teaching and research are all emerging as key themes of Occupy.</p>
